It includes the gift of making any colour appear white.\n\n(Ambrose Bierce, 1911, _The Devil\u2019s Dictionary_ )\n\n\nPrologue\n\nAs long as I can remember, I have had a love affair with eloquence. Perhaps it\nstems from my mixed Welsh and Irish background, as from my childhood days I\nrecall listening in wonder to my relatives telling stories in dramatic lilting\ntones, having long and voluble arguments \u2013 \u2018gabbing away\u2019, as they would say \u2013\nabout every topic under the sun, and wondering how it was possible to string\nso many words together so effectively. Or perhaps it was in school, trying\nthis \u2018gab\u2019 out for myself, in front of the class, and being praised for it.\nAnd punished too, for being eloquent when I should have been silent.\nEloquence, I soon learned, was a double-edged sword.\n\nWas it a gift, this ability to gab? If so, it seemed to be a gift that\neveryone possessed. When I moved to Liverpool, at the age of ten, I was highly\nimpressed by the humorous, vivid expression of fast-talking, down-to-earth\nScousers, who could use sentences as if they were rapier thrusts, and I soon\nadded its character to my Celtic mix. Eloquence got me out of trouble, as I\nnow know it did Peter Ustinov and Billy Connolly, who both found humorous\nrepartee an effective way of evading unwelcome attention from school bullies \u2013\nthe survival of the linguistically fittest.\n\nIn secondary school, I was enthralled by an English teacher who showed us how\nwe could stretch our voices to achieve some remarkable effects, and in school\nplays came to realize that this wasn\u2019t just theory, but it could make\naudiences do some strange things, such as laugh and cry. I did both on my\nfirst ever visit to Stratford-upon-Avon, where I learned \u2013 thanks chiefly to\nthe powerful, resonant tones of Paul Robeson as Othello \u2013 what amazing heights\nthe human voice is capable of achieving.\n\nAnd so to university, where eventually, as a new lecturer, I had my first real\nchance to bring together all those experiences into a speaking style of my\nown, to convey my delight in discovering my second great love affair \u2013 with\nthe subject of linguistics. Then a third, when opportunities arose to do some\nbroadcasting. Then a fourth, when invitations started to come in to talk to\nclubs, societies, and conferences about this new and up-and-coming subject. It\ndawned on me that life looked as if it was going to be a succession of public-\nspeaking engagements \u2013 and so it proved to be.\n\nBeing a linguist, I wanted to work out what I was doing that was right, and\nwhat had happened if a speech went wrong \u2013 when people", "doc_id": "fbfb74db-08f0-4a42-bf77-1070b4a67f69", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3107428780c506263cdb239591b93ed48d2d477a47cb5e4e80d03de7839fec26", "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 9718}, "image": null}, "2364136350093677963": {"text": "is capable of achieving.\n\nAnd so to university, where eventually, as a new lecturer, I had my first real\nchance to bring together all those experiences into a speaking style of my\nown, to convey my delight in discovering my second great love affair \u2013 with\nthe subject of linguistics. Then a third, when opportunities arose to do some\nbroadcasting. Then a fourth, when invitations started to come in to talk to\nclubs, societies, and conferences about this new and up-and-coming subject. It\ndawned on me that life looked as if it was going to be a succession of public-\nspeaking engagements \u2013 and so it proved to be.\n\nBeing a linguist, I wanted to work out what I was doing that was right, and\nwhat had happened if a speech went wrong \u2013 when people became restive, started\nlooking at their watches, didn\u2019t laugh at a joke, or gave me polite applause.\nAt one extreme there might be rapt attention, and I could have heard the\nproverbial pin drop; at the other there might be the mutual muttering of those\nwho found their neighbour\u2019s utterances more engaging than mine. Public\nspeakers have to anticipate all eventualities, and learn to cope with them,\nwhether it is heckling from the back of the hall, drunken interventions at a\nwedding reception, or the resonant chime announcing the powering up of a\nlaptop. Sometimes it isn\u2019t their fault that things have not gone according to\nplan. Sometimes it is. It\u2019s essential to recognize the difference, and that\nmeans learning as much as possible about the way we speak.\n\nI had been trained as a phonetician at University College London, and my first\njob there, as part of the great Survey of English Usage, was to explore how\nthe speaking voice was used in everyday settings. My doctoral research had\nbeen on English intonation \u2013 a central feature of eloquence \u2013 and that had\ninvolved analysing how great public speakers achieved their successes. I\u2019ll be\ntalking about some of them in this book. And it was while I was doing that\nresearch that I came to realize that not everyone could speak equally well. It\nwas something I had vaguely noticed at school and as an undergraduate \u2013 that\nsome teachers were not very good at getting their ideas across \u2013 but the more\nI spread my listening net, the more I saw that some people were just not very\ngood at public speaking at all. Asking around, I found many who admitted to\nbeing scared of it. I lost count of the number of people who, after a talk,\ncame up to me and said \u2018I could never do what you do.\u2019\n\nThis puzzled me. I had to rethink my belief that everyone could \u2013 like Uncle\nJoe in Wales or Richie and his mates in Liverpool \u2013 \u2018talk the hind leg off a\ndonkey\u2019, given the chance to do so. There were many, it seems, who couldn\u2019t\neven begin to get the donkey\u2019s attention, and who didn\u2019t even want to try. I\nfelt this was a great shame, as there\u2019s nothing quite like the thrill of\nsuccessful eloquence, of knowing that you\u2019ve said what you wanted to say in\nthe most effective way and caused an audience \u2013 whether a group of friends, a\nfamily gathering, a class of students, or a group of conference delegates \u2013 to\nbe delighted, enthused, persuaded, and moved by the way you\u2019ve said it. So\nI\u2019ve written this book to convey something of that thrill, partly to persuade\nthose who think eloquence is not for them that it isn\u2019t as far away as they\nthink, and partly to explain to those who\u2019ve already made some progress in\neloquence exactly what it is they have managed to achieve.\n\n\n1\n\nValue-added speech\n\nWhat does \u2018eloquence\u2019 mean to you? If you hear someone described as speaking\n\u2018eloquently\u2019, what comes to mind? Here are some scenarios:\n\nJane\u2019s father gave a very eloquent speech at her wedding.\n\nAsk Rachel to talk to your club \u2013 she\u2019s a really eloquent speaker.\n\nThe prime minister made an eloquent defence of his policy in the House today.\n\nSmith is one of the most eloquent lecturers I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nThe archbishop is an eloquent preacher.\n\nMy butcher was very eloquent about the quality of his lamb.\n\nYou were extremely \u2026 eloquent, John, when you banged your thumb with a hammer\nthis morning.\n\nThere seem to be certain features in common. When speech is described as\n\u2018eloquent\u2019, I think of it as being:\n\n\u2022fluent \u2013 it flows easily and at a good pace, without hesitations, linguistic\nerrors, repetitions, or uncertainty in the use of vocabulary, grammar, and\npronunciation;\n\n\u2022personal \u2013 it expresses, or appears to express, the convictions of the\nspeaker, whose personality comes across in the choice of language;\n\n\u2022appropriate \u2013 it suits the situation the speaker is in, or at least (thinking\nof the final example) it\u2019s an understandable reaction to it;\n\n\u2022heightened \u2013 it displays features of artistry that go beyond the linguistic\nnorms we encounter in everyday informal conversation;\n\n\u2022clear \u2013 it uses words that are known to the listeners, and puts them into\nsentences in a way that is easy to understand;\n\n\u2022memorable \u2013 it contains elements that stick in the mind, so that if asked,\n\u2018what did X say?\u2019 it\u2019s possible for a listener to repeat tiny bits of it (or,\nin such scenarios as thumb-hammering, a polite paraphrase of it);\n\n\u2022reactive \u2013 it shows awareness of the interest levels and listening abilities\nof the audience, and responds or adapts to any feedback.\n\nEach of these, of course, operates with varying degrees of success. We can\nrate someone as fluent but not so clear, or clear but not so appropriate, and\nso on. You might consider some of the criteria to be less central than others.\nBut for me, top marks for eloquence would go to anyone rated highly on all\nseven points.\n\nHowever, not everything we say efficiently can be described as \u2018eloquent\u2019.\nThere\u2019s something odd about:\n\nJames Edwards is an eloquent newsreader.\n\nI answered the phone very eloquently.\n\nMy doctor gave me an eloquent diagnosis.\n\nThe station tannoy eloquently announced the destinations.\n\nFred told an eloquent joke.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference? These last cases lack some or all of the seven criteria\njust outlined. We don\u2019t describe as eloquent our routine communications (such\nas phone-answering and public announcements), impersonal texts read aloud (as\nin newsreading), repetitions of what has been said before (as in jokes and\nscripts), or utterances where we are being given information as an end in\nitself (as in doctor\u2013patient communication). The speakers may be speaking\nefficiently, and making their point clearly, but there has to be something\nextra \u2013 something more than the intrinsic content of the message \u2013 if we\u2019re to\ndescribe speech as eloquent. The message has to come from the mind and\npersonality of the speaker, and not just be words put into their mouth by some\nother person, such as a scriptwriter, unless the text is one that welcomes\nextra commitment on the part of the speaker, and gains from it (such as an\nimpressive reading of a holy text or literary passage).\n\nThis last point is critical. When we describe someone as eloquent we\nacknowledge that we\u2019ve perceived the individual contribution they\u2019ve given to\ntheir speech, which is a combination of any or all of the following:\n\n\u2022an appeal to our reason \u2013 to persuade us;\n\n\u2022an appeal to our feelings \u2013 to move us;\n\n\u2022an appeal to our aesthetic sensibility \u2013 to delight us.\n\nIt\u2019s this last factor that is especially associated with eloquence. We _enjoy_\nit, either as speakers or as listeners. It is, in its most developed state, an\nart form. We take delight in the experience of manipulating spoken language\nwell, in much the same way that we respond, in our individual ways, to any\nbeautiful human-created object. Everyday speech has no discernible shape,\nother than that imposed by the normal rules of a language\u2019s pronunciation and\ngrammar. Eloquence gives it a perceivable shape that seems to transcend these\nrules. It is, as literary critic Denis Donoghue puts it, \u2018speech in excess of\nexpectation\u2019.[1](part0057.html#en1) Value has been added. Eloquence, in this\nview, has no purpose other than to be itself. It is a form of language play.\nAnd that is why some writers \u2013 such as Donoghue \u2013 are able to extend the\nnotion to include written language along with spoken. For them, eloquence is\nsupremely illustrated by great written literature. But the point applies\nequally to the eloquence of stand-up comedians.\n\nMy focus in this book is solely on eloquence as manifested in speech, and on\nthe means by which spoken eloquence is made possible. For me, it is not\nprimarily a literary phenomenon. Nor is it something to be found only in a few\ngreat speakers on special occasions. It\u2019s something that we can encounter\nanywhere, and it can be produced by anyone. There are innumerable everyday\nsituations where we want to be eloquent or are expected to be eloquent. Some\nare informal \u2013 for example, a domestic dispute, an argument in the pub, an\nangry quarrel with a neighbour, a tearful conversation with a schoolteacher\nabout your child. Some are formal \u2013 marketing presentations, sermons, debates,\ninterviews, lectures, funeral eulogies, political addresses, after-dinner\nspeeches and so on. But in all cases we want to get our message across to our\nlistener(s) in the most personal, effective, and satisfying way.\n\nBy focusing on speech I don\u2019t exclude the use of writing to help achieve an\neloquent outcome. People can be eloquent when reading aloud a personally\nprepared text in an apparently spontaneous way, so that listeners forget (if\nthey ever knew) that a written text is being used. Speakers can make use of\nnotes, slides, PowerPoint, or some other support in such a way that their flow\nis unimpeded and even enhanced. They will almost certainly have used written\naids as part of their preparation, and may even have memorized some of what\nthey\u2019re planning to say. Spontaneous eloquence \u2013 when someone speaks\ncompletely off the cuff, without any preparation or written accompaniment \u2013 is\nactually somewhat exceptional in public speaking. It\u2019s there in the question-\nand-answer session that can follow a talk. And of course it\u2019s the norm in\nfluent everyday conversation.\n\nPeople do seem able to recognize eloquence when they hear it. So can we say\nwhat it is, exactly, in the speech of the \u2018eloquenti\u2019 that they\u2019re responding\nto? Can we explain how it is that some speakers seem able to anticipate and\neven control the way their audience is going to react? Can we identify what it\nis that makes us say that someone has \u2018the gift of the gab\u2019?\n\nAs Barack Obama once said, emphatically: yes we can.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 1\n\nYes we can ![Crystal](../images/00003.jpeg)\n\nThat was Barack Obama\u2019s slogan in his presidential election campaign of 2008.\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time these three words had been used as a slogan. The\nScottish National Party had used them in their 1997 general election campaign.\nAnd it was the signature catchphrase for television cartoon personality Bob\nthe Builder. But it was Obama who really milked it, with large crowds chanting\nit during his campaign, and at least two songs composed on the back of it.\nPeople now talk of his victory address as the \u2018yes we can\u2019 speech. I\u2019ll be\nexploring what made it work in later chapters.\n\n\nEloquence everywhere\n\nSome people do have a gift for eloquence, undoubtedly, just as others have a\ngift for playing the piano really well. But there\u2019s an important difference\nbetween eloquence and musicianship. We already know how to speak. The\nlinguistic equivalent to learning musical scales took place when we were\ninfants, and the natural process of language acquisition meant that, by the\ntime we were five, we were already childishly eloquent. Anyone who has had to\nlisten patiently to a long story by an articulate five-year-old will know what\nI mean. Here is Suzie, aged just four years and seven months, who has decided\nto retell the story of \u2018The Three Little Pigs\u2019: One \u2013 one day, they went out\nto build their houses. One built it of straw, one built it of sticks, and one\nbuilt it of bricks. And he \u2013 the little busy brother knowed that in the woods\nthere lived a big bad wolf, he need nothing else but to catch little pigs. So\nyou know what, one day they went out \u2013 and \u2013 the wolf went slip slosh slip\nslosh went his feet on the ground. Then \u2013 let me see, er \u2013 now I think \u2013 he\nsaid, let me come in, you house of straw. And he said, no no by the hair of my\nchinny chin chin, I will not let you come in. Then I\u2019ll huff and I\u2019ll puff,\nand I\u2019ll puff, and I\u2019ll blow your house down. So he huffed, and he puffed, and\nhe puffed, and he puffed, and he blew the little straw house all to pieces \u2026\n\nThe tale goes on in this way for nearly two minutes. It is full of dramatic\ntone, copying the way she\u2019s heard the story read to her, and using some of its\nphrases accurately, but the retelling is much more than a memorized copy. It\nshows awareness of audience (\u2018you know what\u2019), active processing (\u2018let me\nsee\u2019), adaptation of what she\u2019s heard (\u2018the little busy brother\u2019), and her own\npersonal style (and grammatical level \u2013 \u2018knowed\u2019). These are all features that\nare needed for adult eloquence.\n\nNobody taught Suzie to do this. It was her idea to tell the story, and she\u2019d\nnot told it to anyone before (as far as her parents knew). There are\noccasional hesitations, but on the whole the words tumble out at quite a rate,\nreflecting the dynamic of the story. At this point, she had been alive for\nonly 1,671 days. She illustrates perfectly my belief that healthy children are\nnaturally eloquent. And while only some will grow up to become adult virtuoso\nspeakers, all of them \u2013 all of us \u2013 have the potential to achieve a\nsignificant", "doc_id": "b4d057c6-5419-4169-8846-24847fa73b51", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fd70a3fa5de270fc0e71f583ced3b1b8d047f64a412f4a2eb5a6812762b6dd86", "extra_info": null, "index": 1, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 9098, "end": 22645}, "image": null}, "4795613874282630433": {"text": "what she\u2019s heard (\u2018the little busy brother\u2019), and her own\npersonal style (and grammatical level \u2013 \u2018knowed\u2019).

And while only some will grow up to become adult virtuoso\nspeakers, all of them \u2013 all of us \u2013 have the potential to achieve a\nsignificant level of eloquence.\n\nSome cultures take this for granted. They assume that everyone is eloquent, or\nhas the potential to be so. In the British Isles, the Irish surely take the\nlead here, symbolized by the practice of kissing the Blarney Stone at Blarney\nCastle, near Cork, which promises to confer the gift of the gab on those who\nmanage it. But not far behind come Cockney barrow-boys, Liverpool dockers,\nWelsh and Scots preachers and storytellers, Caribbean and African performance\npoets and rappers, and a host of others.\n\nEvery country could produce a similar list. In some cultures eloquence is so\nhighly valued that oratory has become an artistic skill expected of everyone.\nIt can take the form of storytelling in gatherings, marking a particular\noccasion in the year (such as harvest time) or time of day (round a fire at\nnight-time) or a point in someone\u2019s life \u2013 or death (for wakes can elicit\nexcellent stories of the deceased). It can take the form of ritual\ncompetitions, in which speakers seek to outdo each other in politeness,\njoking, boasting, ingenuity, or insults. They might be nationally or locally\norganized, or totally unpredictable, as when two teenage street gangs pass by\neach other and, rather than fight, exchange sophisticated insults \u2013 \u2018verbal\nduelling\u2019. Such eloquence goes by many different names around the world \u2013\n\u2018sounding\u2019, \u2018signifying\u2019, \u2018woofing\u2019, \u2018rapping and capping\u2019, \u2018liming and\nblagging\u2019, \u2018playing the dozens\u2019, \u2018talking sweet\u2019, \u2018fancy talk\u2019 \u2026\n\nCountries that value speech artistry also illustrate how eloquence is not\nsomething for a gifted few, because everyone participates. Several parts of\nthe world have oral poetry contests, often musically accompanied or sung. For\nexample, the _bertsolari_ (\u2018improvised verse singer\u2019) poetry contests in the\nBasque region of northern Spain require contestants to improvise a verse\naccording to strict rules of line length and rhyme. The verses are sung, but\nwithout musical accompaniment. The _bertsolari_ might be given a free hand, or\nconstrained by having to present a particular topic or to incorporate a\nparticular word or group of rhymes into the verse. Pairs of singers may\ncompete together, in the manner of battle rapping (see Interlude 6, p. 45).\n\nAn equivalent challenge in English might be: \u2018compose a verse of four lines,\nwith seven syllables in the first and third lines and six in the second and\nfourth; make each couplet rhyme; the topic has to be \u201criding a bicycle for the\nfirst time\u201d and you have to use the word _cake_ ; start as soon as you\u2019re\nready, but we\u2019re all waiting for you\u2019. The sooner you start, the sooner the\njudges will be impressed. I suppose the nearest thing to this that I\u2019m\nfamiliar with is the \u2018sonnet slam\u2019, where contestants improvise fourteen lines\nfollowing the traditional rhyme structure. _Bertsolaritza_ , by contrast, uses\nseveral prescribed verse forms of varying numbers of lines (as few as four, or\nas many as a dozen). One _bertsolari_ , Xabier Auriza, sums it up thus:\n\n_Neurriz eta errimaz_  \n  \n---\n\n\nMetre and rhyme  \n  \n---  \n  \n_kantatzea hitza_\n\n\nthe singing word  \n  \n---  \n  \n_horra hor zer kirol mota_\n\n\nbehold bertsolaritza  \n  \n---  \n  \n_den bertsolaritza._\n\n|\n\nas a form of sport.  \n  \nA form of sport? At the top level there is a televised national championship,\nheld every four years (most recently in 2013), just like the Olympics. There\nare provincial and inter-schools championships. But the contests are by no\nmeans restricted to such major events. They will be found at all levels and\nages, and in diverse social settings, such as local festivals, conferences,\ntaverns, and dinner parties. It is, literally, _performance_ poetry: a verse\nargument evolving in front of an audience in real time, judged in terms of its\nlinguistic dexterity. In a short online video, \u2018Discover the Basque\nCountry\u2019,[2](part0057.html#en2) a _bertsolari_ describes the art form: one\nthinks and sings at the same time. It all takes place at the same moment. This\nis what differentiates us from poets, writers or musicians. The creative\nprocess and the process of presenting the piece happens at the same time and\nin front of an audience. Having fun by saying things in the most ingenious way\nin order to generate a reaction from the public.\n\nThis could be a definition of eloquence as a whole.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 2\n\nTimes are a-changing ![Crystal](../images/00004.jpeg)\n\n_Bertsolari_ used to be exclusively male, but in the 2009 national\nchampionships, a woman, Maialen Lujanbio, took the coveted _txapela_ (the\nwinner\u2019s beret) for the first time. _Bertsolaritza_ also used to be the\nprovince of older speakers, but the subject is now taught in schools. And the\ntraditional melodies are being supplemented by modern tunes, to produce a new\nkind of fusion. In 2015 nine musicians and _bertsolaris_ from Gipuzkoa\ntravelled to the USA to perform their \u2018Bertshow\u2019. The tunes included The\nBeatles\u2019 \u2018Let it Be\u2019 and Bob Dylan\u2019s \u2018Blowing in the Wind\u2019.\n\n\n3\n\nKnowing how\n\nExamples such as Suzie\u2019s retelling and the creations of young _bertsolaris_\nare typical of what seems to be a natural inclination for eloquence found in\nchildren around the world. If this is so, I wonder why so many people appear\nto have lost the desire or the ability or confidence to speak eloquently. We\noften hear remarks like this:\n\nI don\u2019t like speaking in public.\n\nI really wish I\u2019d said that at the time.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine ever giving an after-dinner speech.\n\nThere\u2019s just one talker in our family, and it isn\u2019t me.\n\nWhen it\u2019s my turn to say something, I just clam up.\n\nI\u2019ve been asked to give a vote of thanks and I\u2019m scared stiff.\n\nI\u2019d love to be able to speak like Jenny, but I don\u2019t know how.\n\nHow did this happen? When did the natural eloquence of childhood desert them?\nWas it squashed in primary school? Was it a result of an adolescent shyness?\nDid they have an embarrassing or demeaning experience of public speaking that\nput them off, perhaps when taking part in a debate? Or was it just a lack of\nopportunity? There\u2019s a long-standing policy in schools of telling children to\nbe quiet, and curriculums traditionally provide few chances for public oral\nfluency. And I wonder just how many jobs there are that require employees to\ndemonstrate high levels of eloquence (chat-show host, sports commentator,\nauctioneer, salesperson, preacher, politician \u2026). So maybe childish eloquence\nfades away for lack of use, leaving a latent eloquence, awaiting reactivation.\n\nWhatever the reason for its decline in individuals, there are certainly ways\nof improving personal eloquence. I\u2019ve sat in on sessions run by speech\ntrainers and voice coaches, and have worked with groups as diverse as ferry\nannouncers and advertising marketeers, and as long as the motivation is there\nI\u2019ve seen people achieve levels of speaking competence that far surpassed\ntheir expectations. This is because eloquence relies on a very limited number\nof techniques which it\u2019s possible to teach and learn or (if they\u2019ve been\nforgotten) relearn. Knowing what they are is the first step towards becoming\nmore eloquent ourselves, and that is chiefly what this book is about. I\nsuppose achieving a high level of eloquence will ultimately depend as much on\npersonality as on ability; but the more we know about the way language works\nin the eloquence of others, and the more we can learn about oral stagecraft,\nthe more we can develop a level of confidence that will stand us in good stead\nwhen we have the opportunity or obligation to speak in public ourselves.\n\nI\u2019m talking now, of course, about the more formal and demanding settings in\nwhich eloquence is valued. I\u2019m not suggesting that the butcher or thumb-banged\nJohn from [Chapter 1](part0006.html#ch1) need to work at their speech in order\nto convey their feelings. Those situations are an ironic or jocular use of the\nterm \u2018eloquent\u2019. Real eloquence relates to speech that is of some length and\nhas content involving a degree of sophistication and complexity. And in these\nsituations we have to manage three prerequisites if we want to be described as\neloquent.\n\n\u2022We need to have something to say and know that we want to say it to a\nparticular audience in a particular setting.\n\n\u2022We need to understand the needs and expectations of our listeners, so that\nwhat we say comes across in a way that gives them satisfaction or a motivation\nto respond \u2013 even if that response is total disagreement. There\u2019s nothing in\nthe notion of eloquence that requires listeners to agree with what the speaker\nhas said; but if speech is to be rated as eloquent, it must make an out-of-\nthe-ordinary impact on those who hear it.\n\n\u2022We need to know the ways in which our language (or, in bilingual contexts,\nlanguages) allows us to say things in this extra-ordinary way \u2013 the powerful\npossibilities of expression hiding within the pronunciation, grammar,\nvocabulary, and patterns of discourse that make up the structure of speech.\n\nWhile the first two points are obviously critical, it\u2019s the third that\npresents the biggest problem when we\u2019re asked to \u2018say something\u2019 at a dinner,\nwedding, or other special event. Most people do have at least a vague idea of\nwhat they want to say, or what their audience wants to hear, and they have\naccess to sources that will give them useful ideas. There\u2019s no shortage of\nwebsites that will tell you the sort of thing you can say at a wedding, for\ninstance. What the sites tend not to tell you is how to put these ideas across\npersonally, convincingly, and effectively \u2013 in a word, eloquently.\n\nIt\u2019s the delivery, in the end, that counts. No amount of preparation or\ncontent quality will make up for a bad delivery. The Roman philosopher and\norator, Marcus Tullius Cicero, commented that \u2018Many poor speakers have often\nreaped the rewards of eloquence because of a dignified delivery, and many\neloquent men have been considered poor speakers because of an awkward\ndelivery.\u2019 And he recalls the great Greek orator Demosthenes who, when asked\nto name the three most important elements of rhetoric, replied: \u2018Delivery,\ndelivery, delivery.\u2019[3](part0057.html#en3) The point was reiterated by Marcus\nFabius Quintilianus (first century AD), whose twelve-book _Institutio\nOratoria_ (\u2018Institutes of Oratory\u2019) greatly influenced European thinking about\neloquence. Delivery, he says,\n\nhas a wonderful power and efficacy in oratory, for it is not so important what\nsort of thoughts we conceive within ourselves as it is in what manner we\nexpress them, since those whom we address are moved only as they hear \u2026 All\nattempts at exciting the feelings must prove ineffectual unless they are\nenlivened by the voice of the speaker, by his look, and by the action of\nalmost his whole body. For when we have displayed energy in all these\nrespects, we may think ourselves happy if the judge catches a single spark of\nour fire, and we surely cannot hope to move him if we are languid and supine,\nor expect that he will not slumber if we yawn.[4](part0057.html#en4)\n\nQuintilian aside, an analysis of delivery is the weak point in early accounts\nof oratory. This probably goes back to the grudging treatment of it given by\nthe Greek philosopher Aristotle (fourth century BC), who in his book on\nrhetoric \u2013 the art of persuasion \u2013 comments that delivery \u2018is not regarded as\nan elevated subject of inquiry\u2019. \u2018Nonetheless,\u2019 he goes on, \u2018because the\nbusiness of rhetoric is concerned with appearances, we must pay attention to\nit, unworthy though it is, because we cannot do without it.\u2019 And he notes that\nthose who do bear delivery in mind are usually the ones who win the prizes in\ndramatic contests.[5](part0057.html#en5)\n\nFor the classical writers, and indeed for many modern writers too, the other\nelements of rhetoric were more important. To make a good persuasive speech you\nhad to attend to five canons. Here they are, with their Latin names first:\n\n\u2022 _inventio_ , or invention: you select what you want to say;\n\n\u2022 _dispositio_ , or arrangement: you decide on the order in which to say it;\n\n\u2022 _elocutio_ , or style: you choose a way in which to say it;\n\n\u2022 _memoria_ , or memory: you remember all you want to say;\n\n\u2022 _pronunciatio_ , or delivery: and then you say it.\n\nMost exposition went into the first three, and this emphasis continues in\nmodern books on the subject. Sam Leith\u2019s excellent introduction to rhetoric\n\u2018from", "doc_id": "635fd166-8a37-4fbe-aeb0-b79d83719fc5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f9b20896ff691c9e89260ac9ddffbe168a49e481034f120730b6fac7a06562d9", "extra_info": null, "index": 2, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 22676, "end": 35718}, "image": null}, "974742433528356413": {"text": "for many modern writers too, the other\nelements of rhetoric were more important.

Sam Leith\u2019s excellent introduction to rhetoric\n\u2018from Aristotle to Obama\u2019 devotes twenty-eight pages to invention, twenty-\nthree to arrangement, sixteen to style, fourteen to memory \u2013 and eleven to\ndelivery. His primary interest is in the rhetoric of political speech-making,\nwhere inevitably there\u2019s a great deal to be said about the intentions of the\nspeakers and the content of their speeches.[6](part0057.html#en6)\n\nMy approach is the other way round, because it deals with a broader subject\nthan rhetoric. Persuasion is only one of the functions of language, and so\nonly one of the functions of eloquence. Denis Donoghue draws a neat contrast\nbetween the two: \u2018Eloquence means saying the right, beautiful, possible thing,\nregardless of consequences. Rhetoric means saying the persuasive thing at the\nright time to the right person or people.\u2019[7](part0057.html#en7) So, we need\neloquence in order to persuade, but we don\u2019t need to be persuading someone in\norder to be eloquent. With rhetoric, the focus is always on the intention,\nwhatever that may be. _Why_ are you speaking so persuasively? Is it to inform\nme, make me remember you, make me remember your ideas, attract me, seduce me,\nsell something to me, con me? Eloquence operates regardless of the intention\nbehind it. Eloquence is optimal delivery, whatever the circumstances. How do\npeople achieve that optimal delivery?\n\nThere\u2019s a _how_ question lurking underneath each of those five canons of\nrhetoric: how do we select, decide, choose, remember, say? How do we bring all\nthese elements together in order to be judged as eloquent? Aristotle thought\ndelivery was just a matter of using pitch, loudness, and rhythm effectively.\nAs we\u2019ll see, there are several other _how_ perspectives to take into account;\nand the most fundamental one, to my mind, is: \u2018How long have I got to speak?\u2019\n\n\nINTERLUDE 3\n\nGoing on and on, not\n\n![Crystal](../images/00005.jpeg)\n\nIt\u2019s often said that the most memorable speeches are the short ones. A classic\ninstance is the speech by President Abraham Lincoln during the dedication of\nthe soldiers\u2019 cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on 19 November 1863. The\none that begins: \u2018Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on\nthis continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the\nproposition that all men are created equal.\u2019 The whole 272-word speech lasted\njust over two minutes.\n\nWhat is less remembered today is that this was the second speech on that\noccasion. It had been preceded by a speech from Senator Edward Everett, an\naccomplished orator, that lasted for two hours \u2013 a not unusual length for such\nceremonies (and indeed Lincoln himself had given speeches of such length in\nthe past). By all accounts, Everett\u2019s speech was historically profound, hugely\nemotive, and very well-received. His elegant craftsmanship can be sensed from\nhis opening words: Standing beneath this serene sky, overlooking these broad\nfields now reposing from the labours of the waning year, the mighty\nAlleghenies dimly towering before us, the graves of our brethren beneath our\nfeet, it is with hesitation that I raise my poor voice to break the eloquent\nsilence of God and Nature.\n\nBut it was totally eclipsed by what followed when Lincoln rose to speak.\n\nEverett recognized the coup. In a note to Lincoln the following day, he wrote:\n\u2018I should be glad, if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the\ncentral idea of the occasion in two hours, as you did in two minutes.\u2019 And he\npraised Lincoln\u2019s \u2018eloquent simplicity\u2019. Lincoln responded, acknowledging the\nvalue of Everett\u2019s own speech: \u2018the whole discourse was eminently\nsatisfactory, and will be of great value, [and] there were passages in it\nwhich transcended my expectation\u2019.[8](part0057.html#en8) But, 150 years on, it\nis the short speech that remains with us.\n\n\n4\n\nHow long have I got?\n\nIt\u2019s the first thing we need to know. It takes time to show eloquence, and we\nhave to know exactly how much time we\u2019ve got before we can decide what to say\nand how to say it.\n\nUsually we\u2019re given plenty of notice. We\u2019re asked to \u2018say a few words\u2019 well in\nadvance of an occasion. There are arrangements to be made, after all, and\norganizers need to have everything in place. So we know the sort of thing\nwe\u2019re letting ourselves in for if we agree to be an after-dinner speaker, talk\nto a lunch gathering, or make a speech at a wedding \u2013 or, at a more formal\nlevel, if we have to give a lecture, a political speech, or a sermon. But in\nall cases we need to know how long we\u2019ve got, or at least what the\nexpectations are. Do we have to allow time for questions? At all costs we need\nto avoid the suppressed boredom of faces which signal that we are going on for\ntoo long. No amount of eloquence can get round that. Anyone who tells an\neloquent speaker \u2018I could have listened to you for hours\u2019 is living in a make-\nbelieve world. They couldn\u2019t.\n\nIn some situations, of course, the time frame is dictated by an explicit\ntimetable. In schools and universities, a class starting at, say, 11.10 must\nfinish by 12, otherwise there will be chaos, with one group of students\nclashing with the next. Conference organizers fear the speakers who overrun\nand throw out all the carefully planned hotel arrangements for coffee\n(scheduled, say, for 10.45\u201311.15) and lunch (between 12.45 and 1.45). \u2018Never\noverrun\u2019 is the first commandment of public speaking. And if someone holds up\na card saying \u2018FIVE MINUTES LEFT\u2019, speakers need to respect it.\n\nWe need to keep to time because no amount of eloquence can override audience\ndiscomfort. And the sad fact is that discomfort negates everything. People\nremember the discomfort, not the content. I was outside a lecture hall at a\nconference once where the speaker overran by a good ten minutes, well into the\ncoffee break. In the coffee queue, someone who hadn\u2019t been in the hall asked\nsomeone who had how the talk had gone. \u2018He didn\u2019t know how to stop,\u2019 grumbled\nthe attendee. The questioner persisted, wanting to know about the content.\n\u2018But what was he saying?\u2019 The attendee muttered something I couldn\u2019t hear,\nclearly not wanting to talk about it.\n\nOne of the biggest dangers \u2013 and this applied here, I later discovered \u2013 was\ntotal dependence on a PowerPoint presentation. The speaker had carefully\nplanned what to say, but seriously underestimated the time it would take to\nsay it. Putting too much information on a screen is a common fault. So when\nhis time was up, he still had several slides to go, and there was no way he\ncould get to the last one, which contained his main conclusions, without\nflipping through the others, thereby acknowledging he\u2019d got things wrong and\nmaking the audience feel even more dissatisfied as they now knew they\u2019d been\nshort-changed. So he slogged on to the bitter end, inevitably rushing, thereby\nmaking his content even more difficult to take in. It was a lose\u2013lose\nsituation.\n\nThere\u2019s a real problem for speakers if the event fails to start on time. I\ndon\u2019t mean a minute or so\u2019s delay. I mean serious lateness. I\u2019m often asked to\nopen a conference with a talk at, say, 9.15 a.m., after a fifteen-minute\nopening ceremony scheduled to begin at 9.00. The coffee break is to be at\n10.15, so I know I have a comfortable hour. But 9.05 passes and nothing has\nhappened. Then 9.10. Only half the expected audience has arrived. I ask the\norganizer when things will start. There is an apologetic explanation: \u2018We\nnever start on time in this country. It\u2019s terrible, but \u2026\u2019 or \u2018The traffic is\nawful at this time of day \u2026\u2019\n\nBy 9.15, enough of the audience has arrived to make a start. I sit in the\nfront row waiting to be called on stage. The organizer welcomes everyone. And\nthen the welcome extends to a panel of half a dozen local dignitaries, each of\nwhom is going to \u2018say a few words\u2019. There seems to be only one working\nprinciple on such occasions: however long the previous speaker has been, the\nnext must speak longer. I\u2019ve sometimes not been able to begin until 9.45. And\nI must stop at 10.15 \u2013 or must I? That\u2019s the critical question that has to be\nasked before you begin. How flexible is the timetable? Usually the organizers,\nknowing the score, have built in some flexibility \u2013 but they haven\u2019t thought\nto tell you what it is. Ask. Can I really take my full hour, or must I trim\nthe talk?\n\nIn most everyday speaking situations, of course, there\u2019s no official\ntimetable, simply an expectation, formed over the years by experience, that\nthe speaker will talk for about _N_ minutes. So it\u2019s the first question I\nalways ask when I receive an invitation to give a lunchtime talk, or an after-\ndinner speech, or a bookshop talk, or whatever. What is _N_? \u2018How long have I\ngot?\u2019 Organizers usually have an answer. They know, from bitter experience,\nhow much their audience can take before they start to fidget and look at their\nwatches. Distrust any organizer who replies with \u2018Oh, as long as you like\u2019.\n\nThings tend to go wrong when the organizers of an event have no experience\nbecause this is the first time they\u2019ve had to do it. Wedding receptions are a\ncase in point. For most families, it\u2019s a one-off, with those giving the\nspeeches often doing so for the first time. The combination of emotion and\nalcohol can lead to long and erratic speeches that leave guests auditorily\nexhausted \u2013 though the effect is usually partly compensated for by increased\nlevels of receptivity among the guests, fostered by the same combination.\nWedding etiquette guides usually suggest a speech of no more than five\nminutes. But inexperienced speakers have no sense of the passing of time. I\nwas at a wedding once where the best man had been advised he should speak for\nfive minutes and he\u2019d agreed. He went on, with great sincerity, but to an\nincreasingly fidgeting audience, for twenty. Some tables, furthest from the\nspeaker, switched off completely and started to talk among themselves. When he\nsat down, I heard him ask the groom: \u2018Was that five minutes?\u2019\n\nThere have been periods in history when the expectation was that a speech (or\na sermon) should be long, otherwise it could not be any good. Eloquence was\nidentified with length. The seventeenth-century poet and cleric John Donne\nregularly gave sermons that lasted two hours or more. Today, in an online\nworld, where brevity is the soul of Twitter, intuitions and expectations about\nthe nature of eloquence are changing. Older people, for whom the book is\ncentral and the screen is marginal, still have a predilection for the longer\nspeech, and recall the classic speeches of the past \u2013 such as those by\nChurchill or Kennedy \u2013 with admiration, and even affection. Younger people,\nfor whom the screen is central and books are marginal, and where communicative\nlife is largely carried on in texts and tweets \u2013 the \u2018short messaging\nservices\u2019 \u2013 tend to think in a different way.\n\nBut they still need to be eloquent. Eloquence is not constrained by length,\nbut exploits it. So it is perfectly possible to be eloquent in the spoken\nequivalent of 140 characters, which is longer than you might think \u2013 between\ntwenty and thirty words in English. And all public figures know the importance\nof the \u2018sound bite\u2019 \u2013 a short and punchy extract from a longer discourse which\nis used to summarize or promote the speaker\u2019s message. If we think of\neloquence as being a truly effective use of spoken language, then we can do a\nlot with twenty or thirty words. Or fewer. Can we be eloquent even in three\nwords? Yes we can.\n\nI\u2019ll talk later about how this sort of thing works. Clearly a short sentence\nhas to be seen in the context of a longer discourse to make sense. But even\nthat longer discourse does not have to be very long to be effective. The\npopular online TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) talks are up to\neighteen minutes, and no more \u2013 \u2018the length of a coffee break\u2019, as TED curator\nChris Anderson once said. Here\u2019s the context for his remark:\n\nIt is long enough to be serious and short enough to hold people\u2019s attention.\nIt turns out that this length also works incredibly well online. It\u2019s the\nlength of a coffee break. So, you watch a great talk, and forward the link to\ntwo or three people. It can go viral, very easily. The 18-minute length also\nworks much like the way Twitter forces people to be disciplined in what they\nwrite. By forcing speakers who are used to going on for 45 minutes to bring it\ndown to 18, you get them to really think about what they want to say. What is\nthe key point they want to communicate? It has a clarifying effect. It brings\ndiscipline.[9](part0057.html#en9)\n\nThe point goes well beyond TED talks.", "doc_id": "d2035c08-0f63-4475-a16b-ad4544057469", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b33299a784f05d807f3d7dcd9994ba5085df47013d8ca1775f9f96d6628b3309", "extra_info": null, "index": 3, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 35753, "end": 48969}, "image": null}, "1265511867282747845": {"text": "the context for his remark:\n\nIt is long enough to be serious and short enough to hold people\u2019s attention.\nIt turns out that this length also works incredibly well online.

The second thing is to know where you will be\nsaying it.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 4\n\nWhen you\u2019re the boss\n\n![Crystal](../images/00006.jpeg)\n\nPresident Gaddafi of Libya in the middle of a ninety-six minute speech to the\nUN General Assembly, 23 September 2009\n\nWe inevitably associate eloquence with great public speakers. Not all would\nsatisfy the TED organizers. Martin Luther King would, for his great \u2018I have a\ndream\u2019 speech came in at seventeen minutes. But Winston Churchill wouldn\u2019t:\nhis \u2018This was their finest hour\u2019 speech on 18 June 1940 was thirty-six\nminutes. Both were brilliant. There is no minimal measure of length that\ndetermines the effectiveness of eloquence.\n\nNor is there a maximal measure. It is of course possible to speak in public\nfor an hour, or hours, or even days. The Guinness Book of Records reports that\nthe longest speech before the UN General Assembly was given by Fidel Castro in\n1960, and lasted four hours and twenty-nine minutes. This was short by his\nstandards: at the 1986 Communist Party Congress in Cuba, his speech lasted\nseven hours and ten minutes. And that, in turn, was short by the standards of\nMustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, the founder of modern Turkey, who spoke in 1927 for\nthirty-six hours and thirty-one minutes over six days.\n\nYou can\u2019t get away with that sort of thing unless you\u2019re the boss. The picture\nsays it all.\n\n\n5\n\nWhere will I be?\n\nGood speakers never seem to have a problem with the venue. They seem able to\nadapt themselves to any setting. They make the venue work for them. But it\ntakes a lot of experience to reach that stage. If you\u2019re new to public\nspeaking, regardless of whether the event is large or small, taking time to\nlearn about the venue in advance is time well spent. There are so many things\nthat can put you off your stride if you\u2019re not ready for them. A noisy air-\nconditioning system. Outside traffic hubbub. To be eloquent, you need to be in\ncontrol, and to achieve this you need to know about the setting in order to\nmake your delivery suit the occasion.\n\nNone of this requires specialist thinking. Eloquence does have some intricate\nfeatures, as we\u2019ll see later, but being in control of your setting isn\u2019t one\nof them. The issues are pretty basic. How large is the venue, first of all?\nWhat shape is the room? And the associated question: how many will be in the\naudience, and will I be able to see them all easily? Which leads in turn to a\nfurther question: will they all be able to hear me? There\u2019s not much point in\ntrying to be eloquent if they can\u2019t.\n\nSo, does the venue need a microphone and, if it does, what kind? To answer\nthat question you have to know yourself as a speaker. Are you the kind of\nspeaker who needs notes or a script? Then you\u2019ll be happy with a fixed\nmicrophone at a lectern, but make sure it\u2019s the right height for you. Are you\nsomeone who doesn\u2019t use your hands much when you talk? Then you\u2019ll be happy\nwith a handheld mike. Are you someone who likes to walk up and down a lot and\nto reinforce your speaking with your hands? Then you won\u2019t be happy unless you\nhave a headset or a clip-on mike, sometimes called a lapel mike (but not so\nappropriate a term if your clothes happen not to have any lapels).\n\nDoes the venue have all these options? If not, it may seriously alter your\nspeaking style and the effectiveness of your presentation. I once turned up to\ntalk at a literary festival being held in a school hall, without having\nchecked in advance. The hall could seat about 500, and the ceiling was very\nhigh, so a normal speaking voice would be lost in the space. A conversation at\none end of the hall couldn\u2019t be heard at the other. The room needed a mike.\nThe school had one, of course \u2013 a handheld.\n\nIt was a talk where I was giving a lot of Shakespeare examples, and I had them\nall printed out as a kind of script, on separate pages, one on each page. I\ndidn\u2019t know them by heart. Some were whole-body examples too, where the effect\nwas going to be reinforced by head and arm movements, and even, at one point,\nby a posture change (one character had to kneel before another). The effects\nwork really well in a small, intimate setting which doesn\u2019t need\namplification; but in a large hall they need a hands-free microphone. \u2018Have\nyou got a lapel mike?\u2019 I asked. They hadn\u2019t.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to make myself hoarse trying to reach the back of that large\nhall for a whole hour unaided. So I had to use the handheld. That meant\nholding the pages of a script in my left hand and the microphone in my right.\nNot a big problem, you might think. Not until you have to turn the page. Try\ntaking the top page of a sheaf and placing it on the bottom using only one\nhand. It can\u2019t be done. The other hand has to help. But that one is holding\nthe microphone. So either you suddenly become inaudible, or you have to stop\ntalking. Neither is going to give you marks for eloquence. And I had to do it\nseveral times. I wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nWhatever kind of speaker you are, it\u2019ll pay you to check out the venue in\nadvance, and, if a microphone is needed, to learn about its properties.\nSometimes it\u2019s obligatory, as the venue has an auditory loop to help people\nwith hearing aids. One of the biggest misconceptions about public speaking is\nthat the mike will do all the work. Not a bit. It\u2019s a tool, and you have to\nuse it well if it\u2019s going to do its job. Not all mikes are the same. Some are\nomnidirectional: they will pick up your voice even if your mouth is not\ndirectly in front of them. Some are unidirectional. Move your mouth away from\nthe front and your voice suddenly becomes distant and muffled.\n\nMany venues use unidirectional mikes because they\u2019re used to recording groups\nof people where the voices or instruments have to be kept apart (such as a pop\nmusic band) or where they want to keep out unwanted noise (such as audience\nreactions). If so, you need to know this, as a unidirectional mike will\nseriously restrict your movement, whether you\u2019re standing in front of a\nlectern or holding a handheld device. Eloquence demands a comfortable\nnaturalness of expression, and this can easily be disturbed if you\u2019re having\nto concentrate on maintaining a fixed distance between your mouth and the\nmicrophone. There are so many factors that can make you move away so that your\nvoice level fluctuates. If you\u2019re reading your material at a lectern, it\nvaries when you move your head up (to see the audience) then down (to read\nyour text). Or when you keep talking while you reach for a glass of water. Or\nwhen you decide to make an expansive gesture with your right hand, forgetting\nthat your unidirectional handheld is in it.\n\nIf there\u2019s a technician looking after things, you may not have to worry about\nsound level \u2013 the loudness that your audience hears. But in most everyday\nsettings, such a luxury is absent. The organizers set a fixed level in the\nsound system, and you\u2019re on your own. So you need to know how close you have\nto be to the mike, whatever kind it is. You don\u2019t want to blast people out of\ntheir seats by holding it too close. Nor do you want them straining to hear\nyou if it\u2019s too far away. One of the most common faults is to be given a\nhandheld and then to hold it somewhere down near your stomach so that it\nbecomes useless. You don\u2019t want members of your audience shouting at you to\n\u2018Use the microphone!\u2019 when you think you are.\n\nEven with a clip-on mike you have to be careful, especially if you\u2019re engaged\nin a dialogue with someone else, such as in an interview. Whether you\u2019re the\ninterviewer or the interviewee, the issue is the same. If your partner is\nseated on your left, and your lapel mike has been attached to the right side\nof your jacket or dress, then you\u2019ll be continually turning away from the mike\nas you interact. And conversely. So make sure the mike is positioned in front\nof the way your head is going to be facing.\n\nAnd know how to turn it on, if the technician hasn\u2019t already done so. The\non/off switch on a handheld mike can be in the most unobvious of places\nsometimes. As can the corresponding switch in the device to which your clip-on\nmike is attached. Opening the cover of the device to find the on-switch can\nprove an unexpected problem, as you may have to press the sides of the device\nin a mysterious way. It\u2019s worth a check. I\u2019m amazed at how often I find the\nswitch has been left on \u2018mute\u2019.\n\nA sound-check is therefore an essential preliminary. If there\u2019s no technician\naround to help, get someone to go around the room as you speak into the\nmicrophone. Not just at the back, but at the sides and front as well. If the\nsound echoes a bit, that isn\u2019t usually a problem, as when the room fills up\nthe presence of lots of people will help eliminate that. And don\u2019t restrict\nyourself to saying just \u2018One, two, three\u2019, like the professional techies do.\nThink ahead to the parts of your talk where there may be a loudness shift,\nsuch as a punchline in a joke, or a piece of dramatic reading, and try out a\nbit of it.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to be moving about, test what happens while you\u2019re moving.\nWith some sound systems, if you walk too far forward in front of the\namplifiers, the room fills with horrendous screeching. Check where you can\nmove without anything electronically horrible happening. And check if you\u2019re\nwearing anything that might rustle or jangle. Conference lanyard badges\nespecially can be a pain, as they can bump up against the microphone and cause\nscraping noises. So can beards. I once scared an audience by nodding my head\nseriously and vigorously in response to a question, with my beard repeatedly\nhitting the very sensitive clip-on mike placed rather too high up on my tie.\nThe rasping made me sound like Darth Vader.\n\nAll of this relates to hearing the speaker. Eloquence assumes efficient\nauditory delivery. But there\u2019s a second dimension, neatly summarized in an old\nLatin aphorism, thought to be a translation of something from Socrates:\n_Loquere ut te videam_ , \u2018speak that I may see thee\u2019. The philosopher meant:\n\u2018by speaking, you reveal what is inside you\u2019. But the words have a literal\napplication in relation to eloquence, because a great deal is lost if the\naudience can\u2019t see the speaker.\n\nSo, look around the room. Can everyone see you? It\u2019s surprising how often the\nanswer is no. Many rooms have pillars with seats behind. A \u2018restricted view\u2019,\nthey call it in theatres. If the seats are fixed, there\u2019s no way the occupant\ncan move the chair into a better position. In which case, if you want your\nwords to reach that person, you have to do the moving, so that at least some\nof the time every member of the audience gets a sight of you.\n\nMy son Ben told me of his experience of being in the company at Shakespeare\u2019s\nGlobe in London. This is a recreation of the original Elizabethan theatre that\nwas built in 1599. The stage thrusts out into a courtyard, and people stand\nand sit on all three sides. The ceiling above the stage is supported by two\nhuge pillars, one towards the front stage-right, the other towards the front\nstage-left. That means there\u2019s nowhere in the theatre where you can see the\nwhole stage. A pillar is always hiding a part of it.\n\nSo, if Hamlet is speaking from behind the left-hand pillar, people to his\nright and left will see him clearly enough, but anyone in front of that pillar\nwon\u2019t see him at all. And if he moves to the right of the pillar, now the\npeople in front can see him, but those to the left of the pillar won\u2019t be able\nto. What actors have to do, then, is move a lot, up and down the stage, so\nthat, for any member of the audience, the pillars become a temporary barrier\nonly a small part of the time. It\u2019s a new kind of movement technique, and\nGlobe actors generally handle it brilliantly.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much difference between actors and public speakers. They share\nmany skills \u2013 pace, timing, voice projection \u2026 and visibility. Aristotle\npointed out the parallel. He says: \u2018When the principles of delivery have been\nworked out, they will produce the same effect as on the\nstage.\u2019[10](part0057.html#en10) Anyone wishing to display eloquence can learn\nfrom the acting profession, especially when speaking in an intimate space. You\nneed to be able to see every member of your audience \u2013 if not all the time,\nthen at least regularly in your presentation \u2013 and this may require you to\nmove around a bit. If this isn\u2019t possible, make sure your presentation doesn\u2019t\ndepend on visual elements, such as gestures, facial expressions, or handheld\nobjects, such as the cover of a book or a tiny picture of the groom as", "doc_id": "1bb990af-3cff-4c78-ac19-683b09d2e0e6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "15b34357ef793fbc64116e186454e94e25031969706d7720f315dc370945a019", "extra_info": null, "index": 4, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 48928, "end": 62463}, "image": null}, "9036812778783038974": {"text": "pace, timing, voice projection \u2026 and visibility.

Make sure you\nknow how much of you can be seen, and whether you\u2019re being filmed at a\ndistance or in close-up, or both. If at a distance, the people may not be able\nto see any subtle visual features, such as pulling a face or displaying a\nsmall object. If close-up, how much of you is in shot? And is the camera able\nto follow you around if you move, or capture any expansive gestures? A few\nwords with the camera operators beforehand will help avoid any unforeseen\nproblems.\n\nOne must, unfortunately, also be prepared for the unexpected. There are some\ndistractions that it simply isn\u2019t possible to defeat, no matter how much\npreparation you\u2019ve made, or how eloquent you are. I was talking to a group of\nspeech therapists once at a hospital in Chelmsford in Essex. It was on the\nsecond floor in a room overlooking the grounds of the Essex County Cricket\nClub. The team was playing at home. It was a hot day, and the windows were\nopen. So my entire talk was punctuated by roars from the crowd and shouts of\n\u2018HOWZAT?\u2019 It was hard to compete, so I tried to build the interruptions into\nmy talk. Fortunately most of my audience, it seemed, weren\u2019t interested in\ncricket, but I did notice that three members had carefully positioned their\nchairs facing the open window. I don\u2019t think they learned much about\nlinguistics that day.\n\nBut that paled beside the noise at the 2002 Hay Festival when Ben and I were\ndue to give a talk on our new book, _Shakespeare\u2019s Words_. Friday 7 June 2002,\nto be precise, at 1 p.m. The astute organizers were aware that their festival\nwould coincide with the football World Cup in Sapporo, Japan, so they had\narranged a live feed into a large tent. That day, at 20.30 p.m. local time,\nEngland were playing Argentina. Japan was eight hours ahead of UK time. Work\nit out.\n\nWe were giving our talk in the marquee next door. And forty-four minutes into\nthe match, at 1.14 in Hay, David Beckham scored a penalty. Ben and I had no\nchance. You could probably hear the roar in the football tent from the top of\nMount Snowdon. You certainly couldn\u2019t hear us. The Argentinians fought back,\nand England responded. It was evidently a very exciting game. Roars came every\ncouple of minutes (though no more goals). Our poor Shakespearephilic audience\nhad a very tough time. Some surreptitiously kept their mobile phones on, to\nkeep an eye on the score. As did we.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 5\n\n\nCapitulation\n\n![Crystal](../images/00007.jpeg)\n\nSometimes the setting wins, and you just have to give up.\n\nIn the early 1970s, I was teaching a course on English grammar at a summer\nschool, at the south end of Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, in the\nfortnight before Carnival. The temperature was in the nineties, so the air-\nconditioning was full on and very noisy, and because it wasn\u2019t working very\nwell the windows were open too.\n\nI was waxing eloquently about the intricacies of the English noun phrase when\nI noticed that there was some audience twitching going on. The students had\nheard what it took me a minute or so more to hear above the traffic. A drum\nbeat. A whole samba school of drum beats. In the distance, but coming nearer.\nSome of the samba bands were out and about, getting in some practice. And here\nwas one of the best, some twenty musicians and dancers, glittering in their\ncostumes, rhythmically approaching my lecture. There was no point in going on.\nMy audience was Brazilian through and through, and their pulses were\ngenetically programmed to follow a samba beat. They looked at me appealingly.\nI gave in.\n\nThey were at the windows in a flash, all dancing, and I was given a tutorial\non which part of Rio the band was from and what the name of the song was. Due\ndeference was shown to my professorial role, and I was placed mid-window. The\nband reached us, and we gave it a special cheer. Not expecting such a sizeable\naudience, they stopped and did an impromptu show \u2013 and I mean show. The\nleading female dancer, dressed \u2013 if that is the right term \u2013 in three\nfeathers, came up to the window, and homed in on the least Brazilian-looking\nspectator. I had never seen feathers move in that way before. \u2018What should I\ndo?\u2019 I asked the nearest student. \u2018Gyrate,\u2019 he said. All I could think to say\nwas: \u2018I don\u2019t know how to gyrate. I\u2019m from Wales.\u2019\n\n\u2018I show you,\u2019 said one of the male students, and I abandoned my window spot to\nhim. Fortunately the band moved on before I was offered the chance to\ndemonstrate my gyratory incompetence, and the class reconvened. I don\u2019t think\nmy eloquence recovered from the setback that day.\n\n\n6\n\nWho am I talking to? (To whom am I talking?)\n\nKnow yourself? Of course. But know your audience too.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s obvious. At a wedding reception, the attendance is\ncircumscribed by the married couple. You won\u2019t know everyone in the room\npersonally, but you can be sure they\u2019re all relatives or friends. If you\u2019re\nspeaking at a Rotary Club lunch, you know you\u2019re talking to people with a\ndiverse professional background. But at a literary festival, for example, you\nnever know who\u2019s going to be in the audience. The same applies to any open\npublic meeting, such as a political or religious gathering. So it\u2019s always\nwise to assume that there\u2019s someone listening who knows a great deal about\nyour subject.\n\nA few years ago I was giving a talk at the Hay Festival about English accents,\nand describing the mixed London accent often called \u2018Estuary English\u2019, which\nwas receiving some media publicity at the time. To fix it in the minds of my\naudience, I thought I would refer to some well-known personalities who spoke\nwith it, and mentioned Pauline Quirke and Linda Robson, the two actresses in\nthe BBC television sitcom _Birds of a Feather_.\n\nAfter the talk there was time for questions. A man in a middle row put his\nhand up. He was delighted to hear me talk about _Birds of a Feather_ , he\nsaid, and he went on to say how the actresses had had to modify their\noriginally broader London accent to ensure that they would be readily\nunderstood on national television. I didn\u2019t know that background, but I was\nglad to hear it, because it was an excellent example of the kind of social\nfactor that fosters the spread of new accents.\n\n\u2018You seem to know a lot about it,\u2019 I said.\n\n\u2018I ought to,\u2019 he replied. \u2018I wrote it.\u2019\n\nIt was Laurence Marks, half of the writing partnership of Marks and (Maurice)\nGran.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of thing that happens at a literary festival. You never know\nwho\u2019s going to be there. So you\u2019d better not make careless literary allusions,\nas it would be just your bad luck to find the author or critic sitting in your\naudience. Shakespeare is safe enough, though.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a literary danger. It applies to any class of people in your\naudience, wherever you\u2019re speaking, as well as to individuals. Are your\nlisteners old or young, male or female, experts or neophytes? Do they have\nEnglish as a first or foreign language? If you\u2019re speaking overseas, what\nfactors in the country\u2019s culture are likely to condition your audience\u2019s\nresponse?\n\nThe age of the audience is especially critical. If it\u2019s a young audience, such\nas a group of teenagers, and you, the speaker, are somewhat less young, then\nyou need to bear in mind the vast linguistic and cultural distance between\nthem and you. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of trying to \u2018speak like them\u2019. The\nadult speaker who lards a presentation with young persons\u2019 slang (words like\n_wicked_ , meaning \u2018excellent\u2019, in the days when this was a popular usage)\nwill receive facial reactions ranging from boredom to contempt. Histrionic,\nhighly crafted eloquence doesn\u2019t go down so well either. The modern\nexpectation is towards a more conversational style.\n\nThe cultural gap can affect the content of a presentation too. A few years ago\nI wrote an introduction to language aimed chiefly at students in secondary\nschool, called _A Little Book of Language_. One of the chapters was about\npseudonyms, so I included as examples the names of famous people who had\nreplaced their original name by a professional name. People like John Wayne,\nborn Marion Robert Morrison. Before the book went to press I had it read by a\ntwelve-year-old. As it was her first paid job she was delighted to do it.\n\u2018Read it carefully,\u2019 I told her, \u2018and underline anything you don\u2019t\nunderstand.\u2019 And when she got to the pseudonyms chapter, she underlined John\nWayne.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you know who John Wayne is?\u2019 I asked, horrified.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 she replied, surprised at my surprise.\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t know _Stagecoach_ , _Liberty Valance \u2026_?\u2019\n\n\u2018?\u2019\n\nNone of the examples from my world matched hers, which I then had to explore\nbefore finding examples her age-group would know. In the end we settled on pop\nstar Eminem and actor David Tennant. But if she hadn\u2019t been a _Doctor Who_\nfan, even Tennant\u2019s name wouldn\u2019t have worked.\n\nSo, when talking to schools, or any group of people seriously younger than you\nare, never assume that they know the personalities or events you cite when\ndiscussing a particular topic. Always check with them, without being\npatronizing, and be ready to explain. Take nothing for granted. As a historian\nfellow-lecturer told me, in the green room at a literary festival, after a\nschool visit where he\u2019d spent more time than he intended having to explain who\nwas who: \u2018Not even Churchill.\u2019 And, after a glum pause: \u2018\u2026 Or Hitler.\u2019\n\nVast cultural distance. The same principle applies if you\u2019re talking to an\naudience much older than you are. They\u2019ll certainly know about John Wayne, but\nperhaps not Eminem. And linguistically they can be distracted from your\ncontent if the way you\u2019re talking jars with any conservative temperaments.\nIrritation destroys the impact of eloquence. Irritation about English usage,\nespecially.\n\nYou often don\u2019t learn about the way a casual usage has irritated someone until\nduring question time, or in the following break. Tiny details can have a\ndisproportionate effect. I have had individuals publicly object to my\nsplitting an infinitive ( _to really see \u2026_ ), pronouncing _**con** troversy_\nas _con **trov** ersy_, using _decimate_ to mean \u2018destroy\u2019 rather than \u2018kill a\ntenth\u2019, and many more of the usages that the objectors had learned from a\nlifetime of reverence for Fowler or Strunk & White or some other traditional\nguide to English usage. I mean _really_ object. They begin their \u2018question\u2019\nwith such language as \u2018I was appalled to hear you say \u2026\u2019 or \u2018I can\u2019t believe\nthat a professor of English would say \u2026\u2019 They are genuinely upset.\n\nThese days, most audiences are more accepting of the processes of language\nchange, and may not even notice such things. Younger audiences are probably as\nknowledgeable about split infinitives as they are about John Wayne. Overseas\naudiences, too, tend to disregard them, as they are usually unfamiliar with\nthe history of complaints about points of disputed English usage. So, most of\nthe time, I speak in my natural style, split infinitives and all. But when I\u2019m\ntalking to an older group, I tend to adopt a more conservative style of\nspeech, as I want them to attend to what I\u2019m saying and not be distracted by\nthe way I\u2019m saying it. I try to remember to avoid these contentious usages.\nAvoidance strategies are part of successful eloquence too.\n\nI don\u2019t mean consciously avoid. Because there aren\u2019t very many such linguistic\npoints, it\u2019s possible to develop a conservative style of speech which flows\nnaturally without having to think about every word as you\u2019re saying it. And if\nyou\u2019re reading a speech, these points can be ironed out beforehand in the\nwriting. That\u2019s what radio presenters do. I\u2019ve seen news scripts where the\nreaders have underlined a danger point in the text, such as _law and order_ ,\nwhere they don\u2019t want to introduce an \u2018intrusive r\u2019 in their pronunciation of\n_law_ \u2013 Laura Norder, as it\u2019s sometimes described. When I was presenting\n_English Now_ on BBC Radio 4, I was sent each week all the letters from\ncomplaining listeners. They do notice tiny points of usage, and professional\npresenters know they do, so if a postbag or email inbox of criticism is to be\navoided, the danger points need to be anticipated.\n\nBut the operative word is \u2018 _try_ to remember\u2019. With the best will in the\nworld, it isn\u2019t possible", "doc_id": "669cff37-35eb-486b-a9c4-e6077e1a9194", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8c97313e0df29664689ff95817280edaf1f5f2303dfe71811c35aa352fecb15f", "extra_info": null, "index": 5, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 62449, "end": 75679}, "image": null}, "7548358405522068050": {"text": "ironed out beforehand in the\nwriting.

With the best will in the\nworld, it isn\u2019t possible to remember everything. Switching the audience\ncontext now from age to gender: I recall a university talk I gave once, in the\n1970s, where a woman left in evident disgust at a certain point. I wondered\nwhat I had said. In the coffee break I saw her and asked her. It turned out to\nhave been my use of the phrase _man in the street_ , in its sense of \u2018ordinary\nperson\u2019. It was a time when feminism was in its ascendancy \u2013 but I knew that,\nand thought I\u2019d been doing quite well in respecting the evolving climate in\nwhich such usages as gender-neutral pronouns were replacing male-orientated\nones (as in _Doctors should ask their patients_ instead of _A doctor should\nask his patient_ ). But I hadn\u2019t even noticed _man in the street_. Idioms are\nalways harder to control.\n\nOld or young, male or female, experts or neophytes \u2026 This third category of\naudience probably raises more problems than any of the others, because it\napplies to any topic where speakers are talking to those who are not in their\npeer group. The risk is to forget the audience\u2019s innocent ignorance of your\nsubject by using jargon that goes over their heads. Jargon is the specialist\nlexicon that belongs to a subject. It is invaluable in its original setting,\nas it expresses technical notions with a precision and mutuality of\nunderstanding among its practitioners that couldn\u2019t possibly be achieved in\neveryday language. But to use such vocabulary with people who don\u2019t share this\nbackground is a serious misjudgement.\n\nYou need to perform a kind of translation exercise. Anyone who wants to talk\nabout their subject eloquently to a general audience has to learn to translate\nthe vocabulary of their world into everyday terms. Popularization can\ntherefore be an uncomfortable experience, until you get used to it, because\nyou realize that everyday vocabulary expresses only part of the content that\nyour technical vocabulary does. Eloquence, in such a context, is always\ndealing in half-truths. The trick is to work out which half of the truth to\ntell, so that you keep a balance between not alienating your audience and\ndoing no disservice to your subject. Deciding what not to say \u2013 which details\nto leave out \u2013 is just as much a part of eloquence as deciding what to\ninclude.\n\nAll of this amounts to an apparently simple principle: you need to know who\nyou\u2019re speaking to, as this will influence the way you speak. And this means\nseeing your audience as people with interests, attitudes, concerns, worries \u2026\nIn a word, you have to be sensitive to your listeners\u2019 _mood_.\n\nWhat mood are they in? Is there something likely to be on all of their minds,\nsuch as a national disaster, or the death of a famous person? A flippant\nremark which might go down well on a light-hearted occasion could become a\nfailure when everyone is feeling sombre. If a general election is approaching,\na humorous reference to the main political leaders will very likely be\nappreciated (unless you\u2019re in a country where such remarks are likely to land\nyou in jail). If you\u2019re talking early on the last day of a conference, and\neveryone has been up late partying the night before, be cautious: an over-\nenthusiastic presentation can make heads hurt (assuming the party-goers have\nbothered to get up to listen to you).\n\nIt\u2019s also important to be aware of what the audience has already experienced,\nif you are one of a string of speakers. There\u2019s a pecking order when it comes\nto eloquence. However eloquent you think you are, there will be someone who is\nmore so. If you\u2019re talking at a conference \u2013 or at a wedding \u2013 who has been\nspeaking before you? If speaker A has been rather serious, speaker B, coming\non stage next, can gain from introducing some humour. And vice versa. A really\neloquent speaker often gets a chair-person\u2019s accolade of: \u2018How do we follow\nthat!\u2019 It poses a real challenge to the next speaker on the agenda. And if\nthat happens to be you, there is only one principle: don\u2019t compete. Be\nyourself.\n\nMost conference organizers know very well who the best speakers are, and will\ntimetable them to \u2018start the conference off with a bang\u2019 or \u2018finish it with a\nbang\u2019. But sometimes they get it wrong. I was once asked to be the last\nspeaker at a \u2018Language Live\u2019 day arranged for A-level students. They\u2019d\nscheduled the marvellous Guyanan poet, John Agard, before me. I could hear the\nstudents\u2019 loud and enthusiastic reactions to his dynamic performance from the\ngreen room a good distance away. When he\u2019d finished, and it was my turn to\nspeak, I had to find a way of getting the students to come down from the\nceiling. I didn\u2019t succeed. That day ended not with a bang, but a whimper. And\nsince then I have a principle: never follow a performance poet.\n\nAs with the rooms I described at the end of [Chapter 5](part0014.html#ch5),\nyou have to be prepared for the unexpected in your audience. A political\nheckle. A sudden illness or epileptic fit: \u2018Is there a doctor in the house?\u2019\ndoesn\u2019t happen only in theatres. A mobile phone going off. A sudden moment of\nunrestrained affection between two members of your audience. A loud snoring\nfrom the front row.\n\nI advise speakers not to take these things personally. There\u2019s nothing in the\nnotion of eloquence which says you will please all of the people all of the\ntime. All you can do, in such circumstances, is try not to let the incident\nput you off. If it\u2019s a heckle, you can build it in to your speech. Audiences\nlove it when a speaker turns the tables on a heckler. And they appreciate it\nif you give them a lead in a potentially awkward situation: if you show you\u2019re\nnot embarrassed by the love-making or the snoring, they won\u2019t be either.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bother me when someone falls asleep, because I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s\nusually a good reason, such as jet lag. (If _all_ the audience falls asleep,\nof course, then that\u2019s a different matter!) The sleeper can be cross or even\ndismissive about it: I recall one coming up to me in the coffee break, and\nunapologetically asking me what he\u2019d missed. And on another occasion it was a\nsort of compliment. The sleeper\u2019s wife came up to me in the break and\napologized for her husband falling asleep towards the end of my forty-five-\nminute talk. \u2018Mind you,\u2019 she said, \u2018you did very well. He normally falls\nasleep after ten minutes.\u2019\n\n\nINTERLUDE 6\n\n\nEloquence battles\n\n![Crystal](../images/00008.jpeg)\n\nI include rappers among my performance artists. I wouldn\u2019t want to speak after\na rap genius like Akala either. Rappers provide the best evidence that\neloquence can emerge from within anyone, and isn\u2019t restricted to the high\nstyles of lecturers, politicians, and religious leaders.\n\nFreestyle battle rapping illustrates the jaw-dropping possibilities. This is\nwhere rappers compete with each other by improvising rhyming lyrics, with the\naim of defeating their opponents by using as much polysyllabic invention as\nthey can muster. Judges or the audience, voting by acclamation, decide who has\ncreated the best sequence of exaggerated and sophisticated boasts, insults and\nput-downs.\n\nThis isn\u2019t something new in the story of language, as we saw in _bertsolari_\n([Chapter 2](part0008_split_000.html#ch2), p. 9), and it has a long history.\nIn English, eloquent insult-exchanges in verse are found in Anglo-Saxon and\nmedieval \u2018flyting\u2019 contests \u2013 a name that comes from an Old English verb\n_flitan_ meaning \u2018dispute\u2019 or \u2018quarrel\u2019. Some virtuoso exchanges have been\nrecorded, such as \u2018The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy\u2019 ( _c_.1500), in which\nWilliam Dunbar and Walter Kennedy swap character assassinations. The flavour\nof the piece is captured in this early salvo from Dunbar: Thow crop and rute\nof traitouris tressonable, The fathir and moder of murthour and mischeif,\nDissaitfull tyrand, with serpentis tung, ynstable; Cuckald crawdoun [craven],\ncowart, and commoun theif \u2026[11](part0057.html#en11)\n\nIt goes on like this for 552 lines.\n\nFlyting was always aggressive and cantankerous. But rap doesn\u2019t have to be a\nbattle. It can simply be to delight listeners. Akala was once challenged to\ncreate a freestyle rap using the titles of Shakespeare plays. His twenty-\nseven-title piece, put together in ten minutes, was recorded eventually with\nthe title \u2018Comedy Tragedy History\u2019. Here\u2019s a flavour of it, an extract from\nverse 2: \u2026 I\u2019m fire, things look dire,\n\nBetter run like Pericles Prince of Tyre Off the scale, cold as a Winter\u2019s Tale\nTitus Andronicus was bound to fail\n\nSo will you if Akala get at ya\n\nThat\u2019s suicide like Anthony and Cleopatra \u2026\n\nBut no written extract can ever do justice to the pace and timing of the vocal\nperformance of an accomplished rapper.\n\n\n7\n\nWho am I talking to \u2013 abroad?\n\nTo see an audience closing its eyes doesn\u2019t always mean that your listeners\nare asleep. It may simply mean they\u2019re concentrating hard or wishing to avoid\neye contact. In some cultures it\u2019s a well-established behaviour. I\u2019ve talked\nto audiences (e.g. in Japan) where most of the people had their eyes closed\nmost of the time. It\u2019s disturbing, if you\u2019re used to audiences who keep their\neyes on you \u2013 as if each person is willing you to look back at them\nindividually \u2013 and who give you lots of visual feedback.\n\nSpeaking abroad, to people with a different cultural or linguistic background,\ncan seriously alter your delivery. They say humour doesn\u2019t travel. Nor,\nsometimes, does eloquence. Even if you and your audience all speak English,\nyou need to be cautious. You may share the same language, but you don\u2019t share\nthe same culture.\n\nThe contrast can manifest itself in all kinds of little ways, such as the\ncolloquial expressions and idioms you use without thinking. Many of these\ndepend for an understanding on a knowledge of local culture. I recall being in\na seminar audience where a speaker from the USA was eloquently expounding his\nsubject to an international group of teachers. He paused and asked if there\nwere any questions. A participant asked one that evidently took him by\nsurprise, because he was silent for a few moments before saying, \u2018Hmm, that\nwas from out of left field.\u2019 And he paused again.\n\nThe person sitting next to me nudged me and whispered: \u2018What does that mean?\u2019\nI whispered back: \u2018I\u2019ve no idea.\u2019 The lecturer noticed the whispering. \u2018Is\nthere a problem?\u2019 \u2018We don\u2019t know what \u201cfrom out of left field\u201d means,\u2019 I said.\n\u2018Huh?\u2019 he exclaimed. His face was a picture. It had never occurred to him that\nthis common American expression, from baseball (as I later learned), would not\nbe understood. He had to explain, and he didn\u2019t find it easy. Eloquent he\nwasn\u2019t. Apparently, the left part of the outfield is furthest from the first\nbase, so that if the ball is hit in that direction the fielder has the longest\ndistance to throw it back. The expression thus means \u2018unexpected\u2019 or \u2018out of\nthe ordinary\u2019. I thanked him, adding: \u2018You played that with a straight bat.\u2019\nAnother facial picture. \u2018Huh?\u2019\n\nMy cricketing idiom was just as opaque to him as the baseball idiom had been\nto a Brit. We both learned something about each other\u2019s sporting cultures that\nday. But here\u2019s the point: after the interchange, the speaker was far less\neloquent than before. He seemed to be checking himself mentally to ensure that\nhe didn\u2019t use any more culturally loaded expressions. And in the bar\nafterwards, he acknowledged that this was exactly what he had been doing.\n\nCultural differences affect far more than individual words and phrases. They\ncan influence the content and delivery of your speech. Some cultures want to\nhear hard facts, data, scholarly references (e.g. Germany, Scandinavia); some\nwant a lot of personal background (e.g. Italy and other Romance-speaking\ncountries); some value eloquence and a high style of speaking (e.g. those in\nthe subcontinent of India); some value emotional content and personal\nenthusiasm (e.g. many Latin -American countries); some emphasize solidarity\nwith the audience, such as a shared educational or locality background (e.g.\nthe USA); some like humour, light-heartedness, and self-effacement (e.g.\nBritain); some expect formality, with explicit respect paid to the chairperson\nand any patrons present (e.g. East Asian countries).\n\nThe protocol can count for everything. I once had to give a talk about one of\nmy books in a large bookstore in Tokyo. I was asked to arrive in good time, to\nmeet the staff. I turned up at the language section of the store, and found a\nsales assistant, who introduced me to the manager for that section. He then\ntook me into a side room where I met the floor manager, the manager of the\nbookstore, and the bookstore owner. After tea", "doc_id": "d36c1748-e816-4b7f-9bb8-a14d06656829", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a74586bd9a5694a5b54d80f6a4049056d3d8c7d62d088e41a0254dc5d50d9dd0", "extra_info": null, "index": 6, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 75699, "end": 88975}, "image": null}, "7776173035126436009": {"text": "some emphasize solidarity\nwith the audience, such as a shared educational or locality background (e.g.\nthe USA); some like humour, light-heartedness, and self-effacement (e.g.\nBritain); some expect formality, with explicit respect paid to the chairperson\nand any patrons present (e.g. East Asian countries).\n\nThe protocol can count for everything.

I turned up at the language section of the store, and found a\nsales assistant, who introduced me to the manager for that section. He then\ntook me into a side room where I met the floor manager, the manager of the\nbookstore, and the bookstore owner. After tea and a well-attended talk, there\nwas a period devoted to questions. I waited for one. None came.\n\nTo start things moving, I decided to ask a question of my own. I turned to the\nsales assistant and asked him which of my books was selling most at the\nmoment. He thanked me for my question, and bowed to his manager, who thanked\nme for my question, and bowed to the floor manager, who thanked me and bowed\nto the store manager, who thanked me and bowed to the owner. The owner then\nmade a statement about the impressive record of his store, and how many\nEnglish-language books sold well in Japan, before finally turning to the sales\nassistant to ask him to answer my question.\n\nThe protocol can affect the audience\u2019s readiness to respond, and this can\naffect your ability to give eloquent answers in a Q&A session, or just\ngenerally in an informal discussion. Talking to a university audience in the\nFar East, I learned that it was highly unlikely that students would ask a\nquestion before their professors did. And even the professors might be\nreluctant, because, after all, what could asking a question mean? In Western\ncultures it usually means that the questioner wants to know more. It shows the\nspeaker has been understood and that the questioner has been listening. Even\nif questioners fail to actually ask a question, but make a long-winded\nstatement or adopt a contrary position, it\u2019s a kind of compliment to the\nspeaker. It shows they\u2019ve been intellectually stimulated.\n\nThis isn\u2019t always so in other cultures. Asking a question can be thought of as\nan admission that you haven\u2019t been listening properly, or that you have some\nmental limitation in your ability to understand. To ask a question in public\nis to lose face. Worse, it might be interpreted as an insult to the speaker.\nIf I ask you a question it means you haven\u2019t been very clear in what you said.\n(None of this applies in private, one-to-one interactions. After my bookstore\ntalk, where there were no further questions at all in that Q&A session, I was\nbesieged by people wanting to ask me a question.)\n\nThe cultural differences can impact on the eloquence of our speech in many\nways, but we should never underestimate their importance. Take the way we name\npeople, for instance. In some countries it would be considered friendly and\npolite to refer to the chair or the sponsor by their first names, and they\nwould respond to you likewise. In others, only a full title (such as\n\u2018Professor Doctor So-and-so\u2019) will do. At the Emirates Airline Festival of\nLiterature in 2015, held in Dubai, it was notable (to me as a first-time\noutsider) how all references to the country\u2019s ruler were made in full,\nsometimes with his role explicitly stated: His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin\nRashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab\nEmirates and Ruler of Dubai. One might hear this several times in a speech.\n\nIt pays to obtain as much cultural awareness as possible in advance of a\nvisit, and these days there are several excellent sources of information\navailable. Foreign audiences appreciate a speaker who has some knowledge of\ntheir country, and who can refer to home-grown personalities in the same\nfield. But it\u2019s important to keep that awareness up to date. Don\u2019t refer to\nthe local experts you mentioned three years ago without checking that\nsomething tragic hasn\u2019t happened to them. International organizations usually\nhave a lot of experience to share. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with gaining some\ninsight by talking to a friend, neighbour, or local shopkeeper who comes from\nthe country you\u2019re about to visit.\n\nSometimes a lack of cultural awareness of your audience can lead to real\nproblems. The organization that invites you to speak should alert you to any\npotential pitfalls. When the British Council first invited me to speak in Arab\ncountries, it sent me an invaluable briefing about the kind of thing that\nwould not go down well \u2013 no references to Israel, for example, or to Hebrew,\notherwise half my audience might walk out. I\u2019ve no idea how widespread this\nreaction is, but it\u2019s always wise to err on the safe side. Many countries have\ntaboo topics, especially if there has been a recent confrontation with some\nother country. In the 1990s, just after the Balkan wars of independence, a\ntalk in Croatia which mentioned examples of good practice in Serbia would not\nhave gone down well, and of course vice versa.\n\nIt also pays to learn something about typical audience responses. You expect\nimmediate noisy, hand-clapping, whistling applause at the end of your speech?\nThen be prepared for cultures where approval is expressed by a drumming of\nhands on desks (as in Germany) or a low-key hum (as in some Far Eastern\ncountries). What would be considered \u2018polite applause\u2019 in Britain can be the\napproval norm in some countries. Also be prepared for responses that mean\ndifferent things. Whistling can mean approval \u2013 or disapproval. Giggling can\nmean delight \u2013 or embarrassment. Want a standing ovation after an eloquent\nspeech? It depends where you are. Standing ovations are culture-bound too,\neven in English-speaking countries \u2013 almost _de rigueur_ in the USA,\nespecially in politics, much less so in Britain, and highly unusual in\nAustralia.\n\nKnowing a few phrases in the home language especially helps to establish\nrapport with an audience, but it\u2019s important to get the pronunciation right,\nespecially if mentioning a person\u2019s name. I\u2019ve heard many stories of a\nmispronounced name sending an audience into fits of laughter or an embarrassed\nsilence because the speaker has inadvertently turned the name into a rude\nword. On the other hand, a well-pronounced foray into the home language can\nreap dividends.\n\nI was once giving a talk on Shakespeare\u2019s language to an audience of English\nteachers in Toru\u0144, Poland, and roped in Ben to say the quotations for me. We\ndecided to use a running gag, with Ben the actor \u2013 now having an audience in\nfront of him \u2013 wanting to recite \u2018To be, or not to be\u2019. He would at intervals\ninterrupt what I was saying, step forward and say that famous soliloquy\u2019s\nopening line, but I would tell him off and stop him saying anything further.\nThen, at the very end of the talk, the plan was that I would allow him, at\nlast, to do it.\n\nThe joke worked well, and the audience enjoyed the moments of interruption,\nsympathizing with poor Ben. So when, at the end, I offered him the stage he\ngot a round of applause. But unbeknown to me, Ben had earlier that day been in\na local bookstore, found the speech in Polish translation, and had learned the\nopening line in Polish, with the help of the sales assistant. He stepped\nforward and said \u2018 _By\u0107 albo nie by\u0107_ \u2013 _oto jest pytanie_ \u2019. He got a\nstanding ovation. And ever since, when I meet people who were at that talk,\nwhat they remember is that final moment. One called it \u2018the to-be-or-not-to-be\ntalk\u2019. My part in it \u2013 the preceding forty-five minutes of eloquence \u2013 was as\nif it had never been.\n\nThe Polish audience consisted of teachers of English, so there was no need for\ntranslation. For general audiences, if you\u2019re giving your speech in English,\nmany countries will want to have it translated. There are two main systems:\nsimultaneous and successive. In simultaneous translation, the interpreter is\nsitting in a booth and those members of your audience who need help are using\nheadphones. Note that _simultaneous_ doesn\u2019t mean what it seems to mean.\nThere\u2019s an inevitable lag between the time you say something and the time the\ntranslated version reaches the ears of the headphone-wearers. It may be\nanything from a second or so to several seconds. Usually the lag is of no\nconsequence, but if you\u2019ve made a successful humorous remark, bear in mind\nthat the initial laugh from those not using headphones will be followed after\nan interval by another laugh from those who are. It can be quite off-putting\nin the middle of your next (serious) sentence to find an apparently irrelevant\nlaugh suddenly emanating from the audience. It will pay you to pause a little\nlonger than normal before continuing, to give everyone time to get the joke.\n\nI find it\u2019s always worthwhile to meet the interpreter in advance \u2013 or\ninterpreters, for the task of simultaneous translation is intense and tiring,\nand they often work a shift system. (The same principle applies if you\u2019re\nbeing interpreted into a sign language for deaf people.) If you have a broad\nregional accent, it gives them time to acclimatize to it. And they appreciate\nit if you draw attention to any points of unusual content or delivery,\nespecially if you\u2019re going to be using difficult or archaic vocabulary (as in\nsome literary quotations) or slang. If your speech is written down, they will\nbe greatly aided by seeing a copy in advance. If your speech is spontaneous,\nlet them know of any effects that are likely to take them by surprise or even\nbe untranslatable. In one of my talks, for example, I illustrate various\nfacial expressions, gestures, and body postures, and there are moments of\nsilence. In another, I illustrate various English accents. Knowing about these\nin advance allows the translator time to decide how to alert the listeners to\nwhat is going on.\n\nIn successive translation, the interpreter is usually working alongside you,\nvisible to the audience. You say something, and it\u2019s translated. Then you say\nsomething else, and that\u2019s translated. And so on. No headphones are needed in\nthis case. But a strategy needs to be agreed in advance. To work effectively,\nyou need to speak in stretches that fall comfortably within your translator\u2019s\nauditory memory. If you speak for too long without a pause, only the gist of\nwhat you say will be translated. On the other hand, you don\u2019t want to pause\ntoo often, as this can so disrupt the flow of ideas that it can be difficult\nfor people to follow what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s a tricky balance, and few\nspeakers maintain it with ease.\n\nIt\u2019s virtually impossible to be eloquent, or be perceived as eloquent, in\nthese situations. Your delivery is now in the hands of someone whose remit is\nsimply to translate efficiently, and you have no way of knowing or controlling\nthe extent to which they are conveying your individual linguistic choices to\nthe audience. Also, the time you have available to speak is now cut in half,\nso that will have consequences for the way you organize your thoughts. All you\ncan do in such situations, is \u2013 once again \u2013 be yourself, and speak in your\nnormal style to those in the audience who don\u2019t need the translator. Some\nfeatures of your personal eloquence will cross the language barrier. And many\nof the people using the interpreter will actually have a limited knowledge of\nEnglish, so they\u2019ll be half-listening to you in any case.\n\nAn unusual situation occurs when the interpreter is actually more eloquent\nthan you are. I remember watching a woman interpreting a speech into American\nSign Language, and doing so with such panache that everyone had their eyes on\nher and not on the speaker. And once, when I was giving a talk to a university\naudience in a South American country where a popular revolution was taking\nplace, I received repeated applause when my banal sentences about linguistics\nwere successively translated into Spanish by an eloquent interpreter who (I\nfound out later) kept referring to me as a man who had come all the way from\nBritain to support the revolutionary cause. Borrowed eloquence can, it seems,\nmake you a local hero.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 7\n\nTeach me, believe me, move me\n\n![Crystal](../images/00009.jpeg)\n\nThe different cultural expectations described in [Chapter\n6](part0016.html#ch6) often reflect the aims of public speaking recognized by\nthe orators of ancient Greece and Rome, prioritizing them differently.\nAccording to Aristotle, you can persuade an audience in three ways:\n\n\u2022 _logos_ (\u2018word\u2019) \u2013 persuasion through the use of reason, respecting the role\nof evidence, logic, clarity, coherence;\n\n\u2022 _ethos_ (\u2018character\u2019) \u2013 persuasion using the character of the speaker,\nidentified through reputation, expertise, credibility, personality;\n\n\u2022 _pathos_ (\u2018suffering\u2019) \u2013 persuasion by appealing to the emotions, arousing\nsympathy, stimulating the imagination, identifying with traditions and\nbeliefs.\n\nA talk on, say, English accents would begin differently in each case.\n\n\u2022in a logos approach, start by defining what an accent is, and showing a map\nof accent areas in Britain;\n\n\u2022in an ethos approach, start by telling the audience what books I\u2019ve written\non accents, or where I\u2019ve studied accents;\n\n\u2022in a pathos approach, start by telling a story about people who lost their\njobs because of their accents, or ask the audience whether they pronounce\ncertain words the same as me.\n\nThe most eloquent speeches make effective use of all three elements, and this\nis where preparation begins.\n\n\n8\n\nWhat to say?\n\nSo, you know how long you\u2019ve got to speak, where you\u2019ll be speaking, and who\nyour audience is. Now to the main challenges:\n\n\u2022what to say,\n\n\u2022when to say it,\n\n\u2022how to say it.\n\nThe first is sometimes felt to be so obvious that it is taken for granted. It\nshouldn\u2019t be.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been asked to give a", "doc_id": "50269cac-659b-4ff9-b2fd-3e616dfa27ff", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9ca4324e4bf9947877322360007be91e46628879e63f8f3f1e576cd9eff3f923", "extra_info": null, "index": 7, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 88948, "end": 102844}, "image": null}, "6017148429520293550": {"text": "or where I\u2019ve studied accents;\n\n\u2022in a pathos approach, start by telling a story about people who lost their\njobs because of their accents, or ask the audience whether they pronounce\ncertain words the same as me.\n\nThe most eloquent speeches make effective use of all three elements, and this\nis where preparation begins.\n\n\n8\n\nWhat to say?\n\nSo, you know how long you\u2019ve got to speak, where you\u2019ll be speaking, and who\nyour audience is. Now to the main challenges:\n\n\u2022what to say,\n\n\u2022when to say it,\n\n\u2022how to say it.\n\nThe first is sometimes felt to be so obvious that it is taken for granted. It\nshouldn\u2019t be.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been asked to give a talk, the theme is usually clear in advance.\nEither you\u2019ve been asked to speak on a particular topic (e.g. your recent trip\nabroad, your hobby, your latest research, the launch of a new product), or the\ntopic is one that convention requires you to make your primary focus (e.g. an\nanniversary, the Gospel of the day, political party policy, the bridegroom).\nOccasionally, as with many after-dinner speeches, the invitation is wide open:\n\u2018talk about whatever you like\u2019. That doesn\u2019t mean what it appears to mean. You\nalways have to bear in mind the nature of the occasion and the interests of\nthe audience.\n\nAnd their familiarity with your subject matter. This is the jargon demon that\nI briefly discussed in [Chapter 6](part0016.html#ch6). You may be able to talk\neloquently about the history of racing-car engines, but if your audience has\nno idea what torque is, or a variable intake trumpet, and can\u2019t expand\nabbreviations such as RPM (revolutions per minute) and FIA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\nInternationale de l\u2019Automobile), you may well find that it simply isn\u2019t\npossible to give the talk you want. The point applies to any subject, and not\njust to technical ones. If you\u2019re giving a wedding speech, the jargon is now\ndomestic in character \u2013 family slang, and repeated allusions to an infamous\nrelative such as \u2018Auntie Grace\u2019. Only one side of the audience will know who\nAuntie Grace is \u2013 and maybe not even all of those.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what to say, you may well turn to a guide for help. Reading\na popularization on your subject can give you clues about how to make your\nsubject accessible to a general audience. And there are any number of books or\nwebsites telling you how to make a good speech at a wedding. They can be\nhelpful, because they tell you what points you need to address (who to thank,\nwho to toast \u2026). But it\u2019s wise not to follow them too slavishly, such as by\nusing jokes that the source thinks will go down well. Jokes tend to go the\nrounds, and the assembly is likely to have heard them before.\n\nSome topics are \u2018one-off\u2019, in the sense that you\u2019ll never have to speak about\nthem again. You\u2019ll never say again what you say at a book launch, a golden\nwedding anniversary party, or a funeral. Others are reproducible. You give an\neloquent talk about your trip to Africa to a local club, and suddenly everyone\nwants to hear it. You\u2019re asked to another group, then another. And because the\naudiences are different, you can repeat yourself. Indeed, there may be an\nexpectation that you repeat yourself, especially if your story of nearly being\neaten by a crocodile has travelled in the meantime.\n\n\u2018We must have you back.\u2019 That\u2019s the accolade of eloquence. You\u2019ve pleased your\naudience to such an extent that they want to hear you again. Sometimes they\u2019re\nsaying it just for politeness\u2019 sake. But if you think they mean it, then make\na note of what you talked about. Because, if a second invitation does arrive,\nit\u2019s remarkable how quickly you find you\u2019ve forgotten what you talked about\nthe first time you addressed that group, especially if you give several talks\neach year. You don\u2019t want to repeat yourself. No amount of eloquence can\nsurvive the bored reaction: \u2018We heard all that last time.\u2019 Political speakers\nhave to fight against this during every campaign. They have to repeat the same\nmessage, but in such a way that it comes across freshly.\n\nHaving said that, if you spoke spontaneously the first time you gave a\nparticular talk (rather than reading your text), then obviously there will be\nnumerous points of difference between the occasions. Time has passed, so novel\nobservations are bound to enter in. And it\u2019s worth remembering the point I\nmade in [Chapter 1](part0006.html#ch1), that real eloquence is a source of\ndelight in itself, so if people are enjoying themselves they\u2019ll be prepared to\nmake allowances for repeated subject matter. They may even look forward to it.\nYou can enjoy each new production of _Hamlet_ even if you know the play\nbackwards. The trick, as every actor and director knows, is to find something\nnew to add to the familiar content. It\u2019s the same with public speaking.\n\n\u2018Something new\u2019 also has to be interpreted with reference to others, as well\nas to yourself. If the occasion is one of a series \u2013 such as speaking at the\nannual dinner of a society \u2013 it\u2019s worthwhile finding out what topic your\npredecessor addressed the previous year. Once again, you don\u2019t want to be\nrepetitive, unless of course you deliberately intend your take on that topic\nto contrast with what went before. Sometimes finding out about previous\nspeakers is easy, as the speech (or a summary of it) may have been published\nin the society\u2019s newsletter. If not, I always ask. People have long memories\nwhen it comes to special occasions, and eloquence stays in the mind. Another\ncomment you don\u2019t want to elicit: \u2018Wasn\u2019t as good as last year\u2019s.\u2019\n\n\u2018What to say\u2019 should always be thought of, initially, in relation to the three\nAristotelian methods that I outlined in Interlude 7, because they\u2019re\napplicable to all public-speaking situations, not just those where your\nintention is to persuade people to agree with you. Whatever your intention \u2013\nwhether or not it is, like the BBC, \u2018to inform, educate, and entertain\u2019 \u2013\nyou\u2019re faced with the same task as those whose remit is to present their case.\nYou need to get the audience on your side so that they\u2019re ready to listen to\nwhat you want to say. Logos, ethos, pathos: which is it to be?\n\nIn my view, ethos is paramount. The audience needs to know who you are. I\ndon\u2019t mean your role or reputation. That\u2019s taken for granted. If you\u2019re a best\nman at a wedding, everyone knows who you are, in the sense that they know your\nrelationship to the groom. If you\u2019re speaking at a literary festival or a\nconference, your reputation has preceded you. As the chairperson regularly\nsays, \u2018This is someone who really needs no introduction.\u2019 Knowing who you are\nmeans much more than that. People often say, \u2018It\u2019s nice to put a face to the\nname.\u2019 They want to put a voice to the name too. It is the powerful meaning\nbehind Socrates\u2019 maxim: \u2018Speak that I may see thee.\u2019\n\nOpening remarks are critical in this respect. First impressions always count.\nEloquent speakers typically open their speech with a personal remark or story,\nand personal reflections recur throughout. At the end, listeners feel they\nhave come to know them a bit. We feel we\u2019ve taken away a piece of that person.\n\u2018Be yourself?\u2019 Eloquent speakers have indeed \u2018been themselves\u2019.\n\nEloquence varies in its consistency. When we say that someone spoke\neloquently, we don\u2019t mean the speaker was eloquent in exactly the same way\nthroughout the entire presentation. There may have been passages where the\nspeech was quite pedestrian. We may only recall flashes of eloquence, but\nthese are enough to colour the recollection as a whole. They are the bits of\nthe speech we remember, and tell others about when they ask \u2018What did he/she\nsay?\u2019 The opening of the speech is one of those special moments.\n\nThis is felt to be such an important element of eloquence that some guides to\npublic speaking make it a mantra: start with a story. It\u2019s one of the most\npowerful recommendations from those who have studied the hugely successful\nonline TED presentations. [Chapter 2](part0008_split_000.html#ch2) of _Talk\nLike TED_ , by Carmine Gallo, is headed \u2018Master the Art of Storytelling\u2019, and\nthe theme is taken up. \u2018Stories are central to who we are.\u2019 \u2018Tell stories to\nreach people\u2019s hearts and minds.\u2019 The stories may be about you (ethos) or\nabout someone else (pathos), but their function is the same. The chapter ends\nwith the words: \u2018Stories illustrate, illuminate, and\ninspire.\u2019[12](part0057.html#en12) To which I would add: and also individuate,\nor perhaps better, incarnate, in its sense of \u2018make yourself manifest\u2019.\n\nI always start a talk with a story. Sometimes it\u2019s no more than a personal\nreflection about the last time I was in that part of the country. It may\nrelate to something the chairperson has just said by way of introduction. It\nmay be about the title of the talk. It needn\u2019t take long. For instance,\nwhenever I\u2019m asked to give a lecture on \u2018The Future of Englishes\u2019, I begin by\ntelling a story about how sometimes advance publicity in the press gets the\ntitle wrong. Having assumed that no such word as \u2018Englishes\u2019 exists in the\nEnglish language, the talk is reported as being on \u2018The Future of English\u2019. It\ntakes only a minute to tell it, and an audience of language teachers and\nstudents is quick to see the irony in the situation.\n\nAt least, that is what I hope they see. Do they get the point? There\u2019s a\nsecond reason for beginning with a story, and that is to gauge the response\ntemperature of the audience. The story may have little or nothing to do with\nthe \u2018meat\u2019 of the presentation that is to follow; but simply by telling it,\nyou allow your listeners (along with any interpreters) to get used to your\nvoice and your manner of presentation. If this is at all idiosyncratic, it\nenables them to tune in to your style. And \u2013 a basic but crucial point \u2013 it\ngives you a chance to check that everyone can hear you while saying something\nthat\u2019s relatively unimportant.\n\nIn return, you get a sense of their mood and expectations. If it\u2019s a non-\nspecialist audience where most speak English as a foreign language, you can\nget an immediate sense of their level of comprehension. If they evidently\nenjoy the story, your level must be right. If they look blank, or embarrassed,\nor start muttering to each other, or even (I\u2019ve seen it happen) take out their\nmobile phone to look up one of your words in an online dictionary, you\u2019ve\noverestimated. I often change my style \u2013 perhaps speaking less colloquially,\nor less humorously \u2013 if the initial reaction isn\u2019t what I hoped for.\n\nThe story may even be about the way you look. My beard has been the source of\ninnumerable anecdotes, but most speakers have some sort of personal\nidiosyncrasy that they can use to good effect. Your physical appearance may\nactually be something temporary. I remember having to give a lecture in Egypt\nto an audience of English teachers and students, on behalf of the British\nCouncil. The day before, our host had taken us on a trip to see some of the\nlesser known pyramids to the south of Cairo. \u2018We go into that one,\u2019 he said,\npointing to a door halfway up the side of one of them. Up we went, and then\ndiscovered that to get down to the centre of the pyramid you had to follow a\nsteep, stepped, narrow shaft, just a few feet square. To move along it you had\nto crouch down almost on all fours and move yourself along, step by step,\ncrablike. When we got to the centre, we were able to stand in the burial\nchamber and reflect on the thousands of tons of rock above us. Then it was\nback up again, crablike in reverse now.\n\nI staggered back to the car, and to the hotel, woke up next day, and found I\ncould hardly move. Walking along to breakfast was a major enterprise. I\napproached a step in the lobby and realized that my legs would not respond to\nmy brain\u2019s instructions to lift each one. I shuffled sideways up the step,\nholding onto the wall. My lecture was later that morning. I got myself into\nthe chair next to the podium while my host introduced me, then realized I\ncould not get up. I struggled out of the chair, while the audience watched in\nsome puzzlement, and clutched the podium at an angle while I told my story of\nwhat had happened. Puzzlement turned to amusement. They understood my problem,\nas many had suffered as I had. This was pathos at its best. I think I could\nhave recited the telephone directory that day and they wouldn\u2019t have minded.\n\nPeople love to hear stories, so starting with one shows your audience you\u2019re\nhuman, not as fearsome as they thought you might be. It helps to relax them.\nThey become more receptive. And there\u2019s a second reason for starting with a\nstory. It fits perfectly with what we know about the way listeners pay\nattention.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 8\n\nIt ain\u2019t what you say \u2026\n\n![Crystal](../images/00010.jpeg)\n\nTo my mind, the best definition of delivery is to adapt the old jazz lyric\nthat Ella Fitzgerald used to sing back in 1939, followed by many others:\n\u2018T\u2019ain\u2019t what you do, it\u2019s the way that you do it.\u2019 When it comes to\neloquence, \u2018T\u2019ain\u2019t what you say, it\u2019s the way that you say it.\u2019 That\u2019s what\ngets results.\n\nNor should the lyric stop there.

That comes\nnext.\n\n\n9\n\nWhen do you say it?\n\nTalks and speeches are usually measured in minutes, these days. The Castro and\nGaddafi marathons I described in Interlude 4 are exceptions. TED talks are no\nmore than eighteen minutes. After-dinner speeches may be twenty or thirty\nminutes (people want their money\u2019s worth, especially if the speaker is an\nexpensive celebrity). Lectures and conference presentations are typically\nforty-five minutes to an hour. Sermons tend to be half that, but there\u2019s a\ngreat deal of variation, and some congregations feel short-changed if their\npastor doesn\u2019t keep them listening for the best part of an hour. Radio and\ntelevision interviews are usually three or four minutes. Top-of-the-hour radio\ntalks can be under one minute.\n\nTo be eloquent, you have to make the best possible use of those minutes. The\ncontent of your speech needs to be structured so that it comes across most\neffectively in the time available. And for this to happen, you need to\nrecognize that, from your audience\u2019s point of view, the minutes you have at\nyour disposal don\u2019t all work in the same way. Some minutes are much more\nimportant than others. It\u2019s all to do with the way listeners pay attention.\n\nEveryone knows what it\u2019s like not to pay attention. You\u2019re listening to\nsomeone talking, and then you suddenly realize you\u2019ve stopped listening. Your\nmind has wandered. It can happen anywhere, even in a conversation (\u2018Sorry \u2026\nwhat was that you just said?\u2019), but it\u2019s especially common when you\u2019re not\nbeing interactive, and just listening to a speech. Anything can trigger the\ndistraction \u2013 an uncomfortable chair, noticeable room temperature, soporific\nlighting \u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t mean to do it. Anyone who takes the trouble to go to hear a speaker,\nor even pay to hear a speaker, wants to attend to what the speaker has to say.\nEven if you have no choice but to listen \u2013 as with school students when\nthere\u2019s a visiting speaker, or staff attendees instructed to go to a marketing\nmeeting \u2013 you want to take something away from the occasion. Nobody likes to\nthink they\u2019ve wasted their time. So it can be quite annoying when you realize\nyou haven\u2019t taken in a word the speaker has been saying for \u2026 how long? It\u2019s\nusually only a few seconds, but it might be minutes, and if something\nimportant has been said during that mind-wandering episode, it can disturb\nyour grasp of the rest of the speech.\n\nThis is going to happen to your audience, no matter how eloquent you are.\nNobody is exempt. Even the most eloquent speakers can lose their listeners\nsome of the time. Eloquence, as I said in the previous chapter, varies in its\nconsistency. But you can lose your listeners even if you are supremely\nconsistent. Keeping up with an eloquent speaker can actually be more effortful\nthan keeping up with a pedestrian one. There\u2019s more to listen to, more to\nengage with, more to enjoy. Listening isn\u2019t just hearing. Hearing is a passive\nstate; listening is active \u2013 hearing with attention. And it can be tiring.\n\nSo, if this is the normal state of affairs when listening to a presentation,\nthe wise public speaker will take steps to minimize the effects of\ninattention. The really eloquent speaker is the one who makes the task of\nlistening as easy as possible. And that means being aware of the factors that\npromote inattention. Some are outside the speaker\u2019s control \u2013 such as the\nexternal distractions I described at the end of [Chapter 5](part0014.html#ch5)\n\u2013 but others are manageable.\n\nThe chief factor is attention span \u2013 the amount of time you can attend to\nsomething before your mind starts to wander. It\u2019s actually quite difficult to\nmeasure, and many experiments have been carried out, using a variety of\nmethods, to determine what it could be. Researchers might ask people to fill\nin a questionnaire about how much they remember of the speech they\u2019ve just\nheard, to see the points when inattention crept in. Or they might monitor the\nnumber of notes students make during a lecture. Or they might ask the\nattendees to send a signal, using some sort of button-pressing technology,\neach time they felt their attention was slipping during a talk. Results don\u2019t\nalways agree, but some useful general points have emerged, often summarized in\nthe form of a graph showing how people listen over a period of time.\n\nLet\u2019s take a presentation of thirty or forty minutes. A popular belief is that\nyour level of attention will be high at the outset and will gradually decline\nover time, so that at the end you\u2019re hardly listening. That graph would look\nlike this:\n\n![Crystal](../images/00011.jpeg)\n\nThe research studies show that in fact your attention varies more like this:\n\n![Crystal](../images/00012.jpeg)\n\nWhat this graph says is that, at the very beginning of a talk, people are\nquite attentive, because of the novelty and freshness of the situation, but\nthey take a minute or so to \u2018settle in\u2019 before their attention peaks. It then\ndeclines steadily until just before the end of the speech, when it begins to\nrise again. It suggests that listeners want to take something away with them.\n(The graph assumes that you\u2019ve kept to time. My story in [Chapter\n4](part0012.html#ch4) is a reminder that overrunning can destroy any normal\npattern.)\n\nThat isn\u2019t the end of the attention story, but the graph as it stands\ncertainly sends a speaker two very important messages:\n\n\u2022Don\u2019t say anything really important at the very beginning; wait a couple of\nminutes, and fill those minutes by saying something trivial, or \u2013 see the\nprevious chapter \u2013 by telling a story.\n\n\u2022Do say something really important during the last few minutes, such as a\nrecapitulation of your main points, or a restatement of a critical message.\n\nThe steady decline in the middle of the graph is misleading. In reality,\nattention turns out to be a series of peaks and troughs at fairly regular\nintervals. Listeners who are trying to pay attention will find their\nconcentration slipping every so often, and then regain it, often by an effort\nof will. At worst, this can amount to the tell-tale downward fluttering of the\neyelids and the sudden head-jerk, especially common in a room that has no\nnatural daylight. Or it can be a wakeful but equally distracting tour of the\naudience (\u2018There\u2019s Derek \u2026 haven\u2019t seen him for ages \u2026\u2019, \u2018That\u2019s a rather\nnice-looking jacket \u2026\u2019), domestic reflections (\u2018Did I remember to feed the\ncat?\u2019, \u2018I wonder where Mary is right now \u2026\u2019), a review of the conference\nprogramme, or a search for new messages on a laptop or mobile phone.\n\nResearchers have tried to make precise what \u2018every so often\u2019 means. It\u2019s\nusually claimed that there\u2019s an attention trough every ten or fifteen minutes.\nPeople, situations, topics, and speakers are so different that it\u2019s impossible\nto generalize about the extent of the attention loss, but troughs at regular\nintervals there will definitely be. A typical attention graph would look more\nlike this:\n\n![Crystal](../images/00013.jpeg)\n\nSo this is another guideline for speakers: if some sort of attention loss\noccurs roughly every ten minutes, they can adapt their speech to work within\nthese spans. Many do this instinctively. They develop a sense of how much\nmaterial their audience can take, and introduce an information lull \u2013 which\nisn\u2019t silence, but a signal to everyone that they can relax for a while. How\nthey fill the lull varies. It can be another story. It can be a reference to\nsomething that is happening in the outside world ([Chapter\n5](part0014.html#ch5): HOWZAT?). It can be a moment for people to talk to each\nother \u2013 to discuss the point that was just made (a frequent strategy used by\nteacher trainers).\n\nSpeakers often use these moments as signposts. One pointer looks back at what\nhas already been said; the other looks forward.\n\nI\u2019ve talked about A and B \u2026 now I want to talk about C and D.\n\nRecapitulation and anticipation. Here\u2019s a real example from a talk I gave on\nthe endangered languages of the world.\n\n[after two minutes] \u2026 so today I\u2019m going to begin by reporting how many\nlanguages in the world are in danger of extinction. Then I\u2019ll talk about why.\nAnd then what if anything can be done to reverse the decline \u2026  \n[after fifteen minutes] \u2026 so there are the facts. Half the languages of the\nworld are going to die out before this century is over. It\u2019s an unprecedented\nsituation, and it raises the obvious question: Why has this happened? There\nare three main reasons \u2026  \n[after thirty minutes] \u2026 Natural disasters, linguistic genocide,\nglobalization. These are three powerful processes, and they are still with us.\nSo, is there anything we can do about language death? And should we be doing\nsomething about it? \u2026\n\nThen, fifteen minutes later, the talk ended with a restatement of the three\nsub-topics.\n\nThe same strategy of introducing a lull can be used even when there are\ndifferent speakers. My son Ben used to be host of conference days called\n\u2018Poetry Live\u2019. Large numbers of school students would come to a major venue\nand hear a range of talks or readings from the poets they would be studying in\nschool, such as Simon Armitage and Carol Ann Duffy. It was an unusual and\nintensive situation for the students, to be sitting and listening to high-\nprofile talks, often on seats whose properties would score low on any comfort\ngraph. There were breaks every ninety minutes or so, of course, but that\u2019s a\nlong time to keep students attentive, especially after lunch in the afternoon\n\u2013 a sleepy digesting period which many speakers fear, whatever the age of the\naudience. So Ben would get them to do a Mexican wave across the hall after the\nfirst afternoon talk and before the last session. The accompanying teachers\nlooked a bit uncomfortable, but the students loved it. And it did its job.\nBriskly standing up and down a few times gave them a fresh span of attentional\nlife, and carried them through to the end of the day.\n\nThat story has a sad ending, as on one occasion a teacher complained and the\norganizers asked Ben to stop. Health and safety, I suppose. But any change in\nactivity can produce the same results, physical or otherwise. I\u2019ve never tried\na Mexican wave myself \u2013 the effect on a U3A (University of the Third Age)\naudience might be catastrophic \u2013 but I have tried other things. If I\u2019m on my\nown for a Shakespeare talk (without actors to help perform the extracts) I\nfind a good attention-replenishing task is to get the audience to do some\nperforming in unison. For example, there\u2019s a moment in _The Tempest_ when\nStephano and Trinculo find themselves on Prospero\u2019s island. They\u2019ve taken\ncharge of Caliban, Prospero\u2019s slave, and made him so drunk that he begins to\ndream of freedom, saying:\n\n\u2019Ban, \u2019Ban, Cacaliban\n\nHas a new master: get a new man.\n\nThe first line can confuse students, who try to say it as poetry. But it\u2019s\nactually a triumphant chant. So I get them to shout it out in the manner of a\ncrowd attending a football match, beating out the syllables:\n\n\u2019BAN, \u2019BAN, CAcaliBAN\n\nHAS a new MAster: GET a new MAN!\n\nAfter doing that a few times, any lethargy disappears. It\u2019s the vocal\nequivalent of a Mexican wave. I like to introduce such a change of pace every\nten minutes or so. It doesn\u2019t just energize the audience. It energizes me.\n\nKnowing about attention spans also makes my life easier when it comes to\nplanning a talk. If there\u2019s going to be a lull every ten minutes, then it\nmakes me think in a modular way. If I have to speak for forty-five minutes,\nthen I know I have four modules to fill, each roughly ten minutes long. It\u2019s a\nhugely useful first step, when dealing with a theme that has a dozen important\nissues all clamouring to be made, to know that, from an audience\u2019s point of\nview, they will find it easiest if you focus on four, and no more.\n\nThere are some tricks of eloquence that can allow you a bit more flexibility,\nsuch as adding a fresh story or doing something unexpected. Experienced\nspeakers can bend and break the ten-minute guideline. But if you\u2019re new to\npublic speaking, or at all nervous about it, it\u2019s a good strategy to take it\nas a rule. If your talk is going to be thirty minutes long, you have three\nmodules to fill. If twenty, two. And if five or ten, just one. You don\u2019t need\nto worry about a change of pace if you\u2019re giving a five-minute speech at a\nwedding. But you do need to keep your audience\u2019s interest nonetheless. How is\nit done?\n\n\nINTERLUDE 9\n\n\nStrings of pearls\n\n![Crystal](../images/00014.jpeg)\n\nThere are occasions when everyone is so excited and fired up about what is\nhappening that normal notions of attention span are simply irrelevant. Nobody\nis suggesting that, when you\u2019re watching a fast-moving game, such as a\nfootball match, your attention is going to slip every ten minutes.

Nobody\nis suggesting that, when you\u2019re watching a fast-moving game, such as a\nfootball match, your attention is going to slip every ten minutes. The\nexcitement over what\u2019s taking place, plus your personal interest in the\noutcome, plus the vocal rapport with fellow -spectators, gives you a buzz that\nkeeps your attention focused throughout.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with any speaking situation where there\u2019s a special kind of\ncommitment present, and people hang on to every word. They don\u2019t need an ice-\nbreaking introduction, as described in [Chapter 8](part0020.html#ch8); a\nsimple greeting will do. And they\u2019re able to pay attention over long stretches\nof time. As a result, the usual pattern of recapitulation and anticipation\nisn\u2019t needed. Rather, the structure of the speech is better likened to a\nstring of pearls, with some pearls bigger than others. It is a sequence of\nrelated and telling points, each one of which energizes the audience in some\nway.\n\nWe see this structure in speeches at religious rallies, award-giving\nceremonies, and company presentations leading up to the climactic moment when\na new product is revealed. We see it at weddings and funerals. And above all,\nwe see it in the political victory speech.\n\nWhen President Obama made his \u2018Yes we can\u2019 victory speech in 2008, I was\nwatching, and was so impressed by the eloquence that I spent the next day\nanalysing it for a post on my blog. The next chapters describe what I found,\nbut in such a way that the points can be applied to all other public-speaking\nsituations.\n\n\n10\n\nHow do they do it? The memory game\n\nI would never be comfortable starting a chapter with a long _if_ -clause, like\nthis: If there is one topic in the study of eloquence that authors have dealt\nwith more than any other \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s asking a lot of a reader. You have to keep all this in your head before\nyou get to the point, whatever that\u2019s going to be. And with two such clauses,\nthe strain on your memory is even greater: If there is one topic in the study\nof eloquence that authors have dealt with more than any other, that speakers\nhave always found to be one of the greatest difficulties to overcome \u2026\n\n\u2018Get on with it,\u2019 you\u2019ll be thinking. And if I went on like this for a third\ntime, you might well decide to go and read something else.\n\nIf there is one topic in the study of eloquence that authors have dealt with\nmore than any other, that speakers have always found to be one of the greatest\ndifficulties to overcome, that audiences the world over have found effective \u2026\n\nYou _might_ stay with me. At least when you\u2019re reading you can read at your\nown pace, and reread if necessary. But you can\u2019t listen at your own pace, or\nrelisten when you hear something for the first time. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to\nhear a long _if_ -clause at the beginning of a speech. Or an _if-_ clause\nfollowed by two more subordinate clauses, making a total of forty-one words\nbefore getting to the point.\n\nBut that is what we got, when Obama began his victory speech to an audience of\naround a quarter of a million at Grant Park in Chicago on 4 November 2008. As\nhe launched into it, I turned to my wife and said, \u2018He\u2019ll never do it!\u2019 I\nthought he would be lucky if he was able to round it off neatly after the\nfirst comma. Yet, after forty-one words and a four-word punch-line, he got\nhuge applause. Here is what he said, after an initial greeting (\u2018Hello,\nChicago!\u2019): If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a\nplace where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our\nfounders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy,\ntonight is your answer.\n\nI suppose, given the occasion, he could have said anything at all and got a\nhuge cheer. I imagine a short, punchy one-liner (\u2018We did it!\u2019) would have\nelicited just as loud a response. But that isn\u2019t an eloquent opening. Anyone\ncould say such a thing, and eloquence \u2013 recall [Chapter 1](part0006.html#ch1)\n\u2013 is going beyond the ordinary. Obama\u2019s first full sentence was certainly\nextra-ordinary.\n\nHow did it work? How can you get people to process forty-one words easily? By\nfollowing some basic rules of eloquence. You first have to think of each\nsentence, or each major part of a sentence, as being a chunk of infor-mation\nthat has to be understood. This is why grammar \u2013 essentially, the study of\nsentence structure \u2013 is so important, and why I need to use terms such as\n_clause_ to explain what happens when people are eloquent. Clauses are the\nmain means we have of organizing complex thoughts. Each clause has a verb as\nits focal point \u2013 a word that typically expresses an action or a relationship\nor a state of mind \u2013 and its function is to show how the other elements in the\nclause relate to each other. Some sentences have just one clause. (That\u2019s an\nexample.) Others, such as Obama\u2019s opener, have several.\n\nHere\u2019s the basic structure of that first sentence, with the verbs in bold: If\nthere **is** anyone out there\n\nwho still **doubts**\n\nthat America **is** a place\n\nwhere all things **are** possible,\n\nwho still **wonders**\n\nif the dream of our founders **is** alive in our time, who still **questions**\nthe power of our democracy, tonight **is** your answer.\n\nAs soon as it\u2019s laid out like this, you begin to see the artistry of the\nspeech writers. It shows three properties: \u2022there\u2019s an evident parallelism\nwith _who still_ , \u2022the inner complexity of the sentence is organized into\nthree main chunks, \u2022the chunks are easy to process in listeners\u2019 working\nmemory.\n\nEach of these is a well-established strategy. Indeed, you can\u2019t be eloquent\nwithout them. So, before going into Obama\u2019s speech further, I\u2019ll describe how\nthey work, starting with the memory issue, for that one underpins the others.\n\nGeorge Miller, an American psychologist, once proposed \u2018the magical number\nseven, plus or minus two\u2019. That\u2019s the title of a paper he published in\n_Psychological Review_ in 1956. It had the subtitle \u2018Some Limits on our\nCapacity for Processing Informa-tion\u2019, and it stimulated a huge amount of\nresearch into the way memory works. Most young adults, it was claimed, find\nseven chunks of information the most they can handle at a time, before they\nlose track of what\u2019s being said. For some, the limit is five chunks. Others\ncan handle up to nine.\n\nLater research modified the claims, but retained the principle. It became\nclear that the span of your working memory is a variable, affected by all\nkinds of factors, such as your age, your knowledge of the subject being talked\nabout, and \u2013 in the case of speech \u2013 the words you choose and how they\u2019re used\nin a sentence. It\u2019s easier to retain short words than long ones, for instance.\nAnd a lot depends on the way the words are organized grammatically and how\nthey\u2019re emphasized. For speech, the number of chunks that can be easily\nhandled is better captured by the formula \u2018five, plus or minus one\u2019.\n\nThis may all sound a bit technical, so it would be good, at this point, to\nprove the existence of this processing limit to yourself. It\u2019s easy to do. You\ncan try it out on someone else (or get them to try it out on you). You simply\nask them to repeat what you say, and to note the point when they find it\ndifficult to remember what you\u2019ve said. Start with random monosyllabic digits,\nsaying each one as a separate item, with the same pitch movement: 3\n\n6, 2\n\n9, 5, 8\n\n4, 2, 3, 5\n\n9, 3, 6, 8, 2\n\n6, 4, 1, 9, 2, 5\n\n\n## 2, 5, 3, 8, 6, 9, 4\n\nMost people sense a difficulty when the sequence reaches five, and become\nhesitant, omit items, or get the order wrong. Some can\u2019t get beyond this. I\ntry this out with audiences sometimes, and get them to chant the numbers\ntogether. They shout out confidently in unison to begin with, but performance\nbegins to straggle when I reach six. If I lengthen the words, the\ndeterioration starts earlier: 14\n\n17, 13\n\n\n## 18, 15, 19\n\nand so on.\n\nAnd you can imagine the result when I use really long words: consequence\n\nreadiness, engineering\n\nhabituation, evanescence, corporation, exactitude \u2026\n\nOf course, such tasks are a long way from speech reality. In real speech, we\nintroduce all kinds of tricks enabling us to hold stretches of language easily\nin our memory. And the most important is grammar. We don\u2019t speak words in\nisolation. We put them into sentences, and the rules of grammar help us see\nthe relationship between the words and to remember them. Grammar enables us to\nprocess our thoughts comfortably.\n\nBut it can\u2019t do it alone. In writing, we need graphic clues to help us read\nand write comfortably. That\u2019s why punctuation developed, along with other\nfeatures of layout. In speech, we need auditory clues to help us speak and\nlisten comfortably. That\u2019s the job of intonation (speech melody) and rhythm.\nAre you someone who gave up, in the repetition experiment, when you got to\nfive or six spoken digits? You might well think, as a result, that you could\nnever handle a sequence of eight. Yes you can.\n\nAll you have to do is group the digits into sets, and give each set its own\nintonation and rhythm. So you don\u2019t say them as 3 \u2026 6 \u2026 1 \u2026 5, but as 3615,\nwith the emphasis on the 5 \u2013 just as you would say a telephone number. Now try\nthat with eight digits: 3615 \u2026 8294. Look away now, and you\u2019ll remember it. If\nyou asked someone for their number, and that is what they said, you\u2019d be able\nto write it down quite easily.\n\nSo, to return to Obama. I\u2019ll now present his opening sentence as a series of\nintonation-plus-rhythm chunks, marking the main pauses. It looks like this: if\nthere - is anyone out there --\n\nwho still doubts - that America is a place where all things are possible --\n\nwho still wonders - if the dream of our founders is alive in our time --\n\nwho still questions - the power of our democracy --\n\ntonight is your answer.\n\nNow to add up the information-carrying elements in each chunk. Omit the words\nwhose job is solely to link these elements (\u2018grammatical words\u2019, such as _if_\n, _a_ , _the_ , _in_ , _is_ , _where_ ). We end up with this:\n\nanyone + out-there  \n  \n---\n\n\n## 2  \n  \n---  \n  \nstill + doubts\n\n\n## 2  \n  \n---  \n  \nAmerica + place + all + things + possible\n\n\n## 5  \n  \n---  \n  \nstill + wonders\n\n\n## 2  \n  \n---  \n  \ndream + founders + alive + time\n\n\n## 4  \n  \n---  \n  \nstill + questions\n\n\n## 2  \n  \n---  \n  \npower + democracy\n\n\n## 2  \n  \n---  \n  \ntonight + answer\n\n\n## 2  \n  \n---  \n  \nThis is comfortable processing, both for speaker and listener. And note that\nthe longest sequence is less than it seems, because _things_ is a semantically\nempty word. _All things_ might have been replaced with _everything_ without\nloss. That line is really only four chunks of serious information:\n\nAmerica + place + all-things + possible  \n  \n---\n\n\n## 4  \n  \n---  \n  \nIn fact the demands on the listener are even less than the numbers suggest\nbecause of the structural parallelism: _still doubts \u2026 still wonders \u2026 still\nquestions_ \u2026 When a word is set up as part of a pattern, we don\u2019t need to\ndevote any fresh processing energy to it the second time it occurs, or the\nthird time. It\u2019s not \u2018new news\u2019 any more. And that allows us more energy to\nconcentrate on the following verbs \u2013 _doubts_ \u2026 _wonders_ \u2026 _questions_ \u2013 that\nare actually the heart of this sentence. It\u2019s these verbs that give a focus to\nthe emotionally charged nouns that accompany them: _America_ , _power_ ,\n_democracy_ , and the echoes of earlier famous speeches \u2013 _founders_ (Abraham\nLincoln) and _dream_ (Martin Luther King).\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating \u2013 well, it is if you\u2019re a linguist \u2013 to go through a speech\nlike this and identify the processing chunks. And to note the occasional\nplaces where the speaker dares to deliver a chunk that goes beyond that. I\u2019ll\ntake just the next two paragraphs to illustrate this, because they show how\nObama carries on with his pattern of \u2018easy listening\u2019, daring to do something\na bit more challenging at one point. Once again, I\u2019ll lay it out in rhythm\nunits and totals, with each information element shown in bold:\n\nIt\u2019s the **answer told** by **lines** that **stretched** around **schools**\nand **churches**  \n  \n---\n\n\n## 6  \n  \n---  \n  \nin **numbers** this **nation** has **never seen**\n\n\n## 4  \n  \n---  \n  \nby **people** who **waited three hours** and **four hours**\n\n\n## 6  \n  \n---  \n  \n**many** for the **first time** in their **lives**\n\n\n## 4  \n  \n---  \n  \nbecause they **believed** that this **time** must be **different**\n\n\n## 3  \n  \n---  \n  \nthat their", "doc_id": "f4301f10-442a-40de-8fa2-938f0dec88a8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "201fe629a9898ff2e99f43b15897f97b666d6a796ef9229344eba32ced8de9a1", "extra_info": null, "index": 10, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 129497, "end": 142357}, "image": null}, "1568503296491793266": {"text": "bit more challenging at one point.

In information terms, _three hours and four\nhours_ = _three and four hours_. And the surprising 7 is actually 6, with\n_collection_ being used twice \u2013 or even 5, if you reflect on how little is\nactually being added semantically by the intensifying word _just_.\n\nObama\u2019s opening sentence contains three instances of _still_ plus verb. That\u2019s\nnot by chance. It\u2019s another instance of careful planning. In fact, if any\nnumber is magical, in the context of eloquence, it\u2019s the number three. And\nalso \u2013 noting the parallelism that binds the chunks in the third paragraph \u2013\nthe number two.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 10\n\n\nShakespeare was there first\n\n![Crystal](../images/00015.jpeg)\n\nGenerations of schoolchildren have been told that, if they know nothing else\nabout Shakespeare, they should know that he wrote in iambic pentameters. They\naren\u2019t usually told why.\n\nThe answer is not that it was the literary fashion of the day. That\u2019s true,\nbut it begs the question. _Why_ was it the fashion of the day? What is it\nabout the iambic pentameter that made it so appealing to the dramatists of the\ntime?\n\n\u2018The magical number five\u2019 is the answer. An iambic pentameter is a line of\nfive \u2018te-tum\u2019 beats, each one of which can be the focus of a unit of\ninformation (shown here with a slash): How sweet / the moonlight / sleeps /\nupon / this bank I come / to bury / Caesar / not to / praise him.\n\nIt became the heartbeat of much succeeding English poetry: The curfew / tolls\n/ the knell / of parting / day (Thomas Gray)\n\nAnd all / that mighty / heart / is lying / still (William Wordsworth)\n\nOnly a small proportion of the verse lines in Shakespeare are totally regular\nmetrically, but the vast majority are \u2018of a length\u2019, and the chunks of\ninformation they convey are typically four or five. This makes them easy to\nprocess as a listener \u2013 and easy to remember if you\u2019re an actor. In\nElizabethan theatre, actors had to present a fresh play every day, with a very\nshort time to learn their lines. The five-unit line would have been the most\nfacilitating of measures.\n\n\n11\n\nHow do they do it? The rule of three\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that seems to promote eloquent language more than\nanything else I describe in this book, that is found repeatedly in the speech\nof any orator I\u2019ve ever listened to, that appears in every language I\u2019ve ever\nstudied, it\u2019s the \u2018rule of three\u2019.\n\nEloquence is infectious. You notice a clever trick in an eloquent speech and\nthink to yourself, \u2018I could do that\u2019. So you try it out. And if it works, you\nkeep it in your repertoire. One of the best bits of advice if you\u2019re an\ninexperienced speaker is to listen to as many speeches as possible, and\ncherry-pick the successful strategies that you think will best suit your own\npersonal style.\n\nThe rule of three is one of the oldest tricks in the eloquence business. All\npublic speakers know that they can get a round of applause if they use a\ntriple with structural parallelism:\n\nI was with you yesterday!\n\nI am with you today!\n\nAnd I will be with you tomorrow! [Cheers]\n\nYou have to put it across effectively, of course, with a crescendo peaking on\nthe third item. It would be a curiously bathetic effect if you started with\nmaximum loudness on the first item and ended with a pianissimo on the third.\n\nWhat you must never do, of course, is overdo it. Imagine a speaker who has\njust produced a triple like that. If he went on to immediately produce another\none, the effect would begin to pall.\n\nI said this in Brussels!\n\nI said it in New York!\n\nAnd I am saying it now in London! [??Cheers]\n\nIf a rhetorical trick is used twice in quick succession, listeners begin to\nnotice it, and that\u2019s the worst thing that can happen to a speaker. When the\nstyle gets in front of the message it becomes a distraction instead of a\nreinforcement. It\u2019s the same with any art form: seeing the brush strokes\nrather than the painting, or hearing the virtuoso playing rather than the\nconcerto. The French essayist Michel de Montaigne makes the point: \u2018Shame on\nall eloquence which leaves us with a taste for itself not for its\nsubstance.\u2019[13](part0057.html#en13)\n\nThe strategy operates regardless of gender, age, class, or occupation:\n\nWe now know that it is not government, but free enterprise, which is capable\nof creating wealth, providing jobs and raising living standards.\n\n(Margaret Thatcher, 12 December 1990)\n\nTalk to your friends, your family, your neighbours.\n\n(Hillary Clinton, 13 June 2015)\n\n\u2026 a time defined by selfishness and greed, inculcated cruelty and\ninstitutionalized self-centredness \u2026\n\n(Russell Brand, 28 July 2015)\n\n\u2026 they should be more clear with us about who the military is fighting for,\nwho our tax dollars are supporting and, ultimately, how much does the prime\nrib cost?\n\n(Lady Gaga, 20 September 2010)\n\nAnd a powerful double triple from Aung Sang Suu Kyi:\n\nIt is not enough merely to call for freedom, democracy and human rights. There\nhas to be a united determination to persevere in the struggle, to make\nsacrifices in the name of enduring truths, to resist the corrupting influences\nof desire, ill will, ignorance and fear.[14](part0057.html#en14)\n\nIf we explore their entire speeches, we find triples popping up all over the\nplace, but not in such a way that they draw attention to themselves. That\u2019s\nthe clever bit: to hide the virtuosity.\n\nHow is it done? By varying the way in which triples are used. It\u2019s not just\nclauses that can be grouped in threes. It could be phrases, single words, or\nwhole paragraphs. Obama uses each of these in his next three paragraphs. Here\nthey are in full, with the triples in bold and main pauses marked by dashes\n(and including any hesitancies, such as \u2018th\u2019 below):\n\n**It\u2019s - the answer** told by lines that stretched around schools and churches\n-- in numbers this nation has never seen -- by people who waited three hours\nand four hours -- many for the first time in their lives -- because they\nbelieved that this time - must be different -- that their voices - could be\nthat difference.\n\n**It\u2019s the answer** spoken by young and old -- rich and poor -- Democrat and\nRepublican -- black, white -- Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight\n\u2013 disabled and not disabled - Americans who sent a message to the world - that\nwe have never been - just a collection of individuals or a collection of red\nstates and blue states - we are and always will be the United States of\nAmerica.\n\n**It\u2019s the answer** \\- th that led those - who\u2019ve been told for so long - by\nso many to be **cynical - and fearful - and doubtful** about what we can\nachieve - to put their hands on the arc of history -- and bend it once more\ntoward - the hope of a better day. - It\u2019s been a long time coming - but\ntonight - because of what we did **on this day - in this election - at this\ndefining moment** \\- change has come to America.\n\nTriples continue throughout the rest of the speech, as we\u2019ll see, but at\nintervals, so that they don\u2019t become intrusive.\n\nWhat tricks are used to fill the spaces between the triples? A different\nstylistic technique is needed, to provide variety and maintain pace, and the\nmost common is the \u2018magical number two\u2019 \u2013 the use of pairs, and pairs within\npairs. Here\u2019s the second paragraph again, but this time with the pairs in\nsquare brackets:\n\nIt\u2019s - the answer told [by lines that stretched around [schools and churches]\n-- in numbers this nation has never seen] -- [by people who waited [three\nhours and four hours] -- many for the first time in their lives] -- because\nthey believed [that this time - must be different -- that their voices - could\nbe that difference].\n\nThe \u2018by lines\u2019 and \u2018by people\u2019 contrast is a pair \u2013 but each contains another\npair. Note how, strictly speaking, the pairing is unnecessary. He could have\nsaid simply:\n\nlines that stretched around buildings \u2026 by people who waited hours \u2026\n\nbut the pairing is semantically more concrete and rhythmically more effective.\nA triad would have been unwise here, for the underlying meaning is actually\nrather banal, and to keep it going would be to produce a feeling of padding:\n\nby people who waited three hours and four hours and five hours \u2026\n\nSpeakers who haven\u2019t really got anything to say do this a lot. The speech\nfills the time, but listeners go away wondering what they got out of it.\n\nPairs, as with triples, have to vary if they\u2019re not to become boring. The main\npairings in the second paragraph are quite complex \u2013 whole clauses. What Obama\ndoes in his third paragraph is, to my mind, the most daring piece in the whole\nspeech: a list almost entirely consisting of pairs:\n\nIt\u2019s the answer spoken by [young and old] -- [rich and poor] -- [Democrat and\nRepublican] -- [black, white] - Hispanic, Asian, Native American [gay,\nstraight] - [disabled and not disabled] - Americans who sent a message to the\nworld - that we have never been - just [a collection of individuals] or [a\ncollection of [red states] and [blue states]] - we [are and always will be]\nthe United States of America.\n\nBeware lists, especially lists of people! They\u2019re dangerous things, because\nthey prompt listeners to notice who might have been left out \u2013 although that\nday I don\u2019t think anyone was counting. This was a hugely effective listing,\nwhich generated sporadic applause throughout.\n\nYou\u2019ll have noticed that the pairs aren\u2019t all the same. Some pairs are linked\nby _and_ , and some aren\u2019t. The \u2018collection\u2019 pairing is linked by _or_. Why?\nJust as triads have to vary to avoid monotony, so do pairs. It could become a\nboring list otherwise. But there\u2019s a subtle semantic issue also. The omission\nof _and_ reduces the force of the contrast and allows the suggestion that the\nlist can be extended. Unlike _young and old_ and the others, the list of\nethnic groups is open-ended. It implies that there are other groups apart from\nthe ones mentioned, and this suggestion is reinforced by an uncoordinated\ntriple ( _Hispanic, Asian, Native American_ \u2026). Notice how this effect would\nbe lost if _and_ were added: _Hispanic, Asian, and Native American_. Running\nstraight on to _gay, straight_ without a pause also helps to avoid giving the\nimpression that the list is complete.\n\nAs I mentioned in [Chapter 6](part0016.html#ch6), eloquence is two--sided: you\nhave to know what to say and also what not to say. It\u2019s the same for\nrhetorical structures such as pairs and triples. You have to know when to use\nthem and when not to use them. Obama\u2019s next section is a good illustration \u2013 a\nseries of paragraphs of acknowledgments and thanks. It needs to be quoted at\nlength, as it\u2019s a complete change in content, tone, and pace, and displays a\ndifferent kind of eloquence:\n\nA little bit earlier this evening - I I received - an extraordinarily gracious\ncall from - Senator McCain. --- Senator McCain fought long and hard in this\ncampaign, -- and he\u2019s - fought even longer and harder - for the country that\nhe loves. -- He has endured sacrifices for America - that most of us cannot\nbegin to imagine. -- We are better off for the service rendered by this brave\nand selfless - leader. -- I congratulate him -- I congratulate Governor Palin\n- for all that they\u2019ve achieved, - and I look forward to working with them -\nto renew this nation\u2019s promise in the months ahead. ---\n\nI want to thank - my partner in this journey, -- a man who campaigned from his\nheart - and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of\nScranton, - and rode with on the train home to Delaware, - the vice president\n--elect of the United States, Joe Biden. ---\n\nAnd", "doc_id": "cfa2e7e5-b859-4726-8222-2d3d81dce93d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bd35aceb021bd0b968d00487f25dedddf465b0fe799a15f969f6bd6c039973fc", "extra_info": null, "index": 11, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 142464, "end": 155486}, "image": null}, "4882014036442733543": {"text": "- fought even longer and harder - for the country that\nhe loves. -- He has endured sacrifices for America - that most of us cannot\nbegin to imagine. -- We are better off for the service rendered by this brave\nand selfless - leader. -- I congratulate him -- I congratulate Governor Palin\n- for all that they\u2019ve achieved, - and I look forward to working with them -\nto renew this nation\u2019s promise in the months ahead. ---\n\nI want to thank - my partner in this journey, -- a man who campaigned from his\nheart - and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of\nScranton, - and rode with on the train home to Delaware, - the vice president\n--elect of the United States, Joe Biden. ---\n\nAnd I would not be standing here - tonight without - the unyielding support -\nof my best friend - for the last sixteen years, - the rock of our family, -\nthe love of my life, - the nation\u2019s next First Lady, - Michelle Obama. ---\n\nSasha and Malia, -- I love you both more than you can imagine, - and you have\nearned the new puppy that\u2019s coming with us to the White House. ---\n\nAnd while - she\u2019s no longer with us, -- I know my grandmother\u2019s watching, --\nalong with the family that made me who I am. -- I miss them tonight -- I know\nthat - my debt to them is beyond measure. --\n\nTo my sister Maya, - my sister Auma, - all my other brothers and sisters, -\nthank you so much for all the support that you\u2019ve given to me. - I am grateful\nto them. ---\n\nTo my campaign manager, - David Plouffe, - the unsung hero of this campaign\nwho built the best - the best political campaign I think in the history of the\nUnited States of America --- to my - chief strategist, David Axelrod -- who\nhas been -- a partner with me every step of the way - to the best campaign\nteam ever assembled in the history of politics - you made this happen, - and I\nam forever grateful - for what you\u2019ve sacrificed to get it done.\n\nBut above all, -- I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. -- It\nbelongs to you. - It belongs to you.\n\nIt\u2019s a highly personal sequence (pathos) and this kind of sincerity needs to\nbe expressed in a more loosely structured language. No climactic rhetoric\nwanted here. Sentences are shorter, the vocabulary is more private and down-\nto-earth, and the only hint of elaborate structuring is a single triple in\nhonour of his wife: _the rock of our family, the love of my life, the nation\u2019s\nnext First Lady_. The contrast with the rousing first section is striking.\nPeople cheered, but they were cheers of affirmation or sympathy rather than of\ntriumph.\n\nWhen you\u2019re analysing a speech like this, it\u2019s always interesting to pretend\nto be the speech-writer, and try out alternatives. For instance, take the last\nsentence of the paragraph focusing on Obama\u2019s defeated election opponents:\n\nI congratulate him [McCain], -- I congratulate Governor Palin - for all that\nthey\u2019ve achieved, - and I look forward to working with them - to renew this\nnation\u2019s promise in the months ahead.\n\nWhat would happen if we added in a triple here?\n\nI congratulate him, - I applaud him, - I salute him \u2026\n\nor here?\n\n\u2026 for all that they\u2019ve achieved, - for all that they\u2019re achieving, - for all\nthat they will achieve \u2026\n\nThe effect is immediately one of insincerity. Deep down, everyone knows,\nespecially after a heated campaign, that praise of an opponent is conventional\npoliteness, even if it is genuinely meant. You don\u2019t expend the rhetorical\nenergy of a triple on a conventional statement. Triples here would sound\nhollow or, worse, sarcastic.\n\nBy contrast, what would happen if we took the one piece of elaborate rhetoric\nin this sequence and cut that down to size?\n\nAnd I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my\nbest friend for the last sixteen years, the nation\u2019s next First Lady, Michelle\nObama.\n\nCompared with the original, I feel somewhat underwhelmed. And \u2013 imagining\nmyself in Obama\u2019s position \u2013 a less-than-glowing tribute could result in a\ncool homecoming. \u2018Am I only your best friend?\u2019\n\n\nINTERLUDE 11\n\n\nThree centuries of triples\n\n![Crystal](../images/00016.jpeg)\n\nThere\u2019s nothing new about the use of eloquent triples. Here is an example from\na century ago, from the middle of Emmeline Pankhurst\u2019s \u2018Freedom or death\u2019\nspeech delivered in Hartford, Connecticut, on 13 November 1913:\n\nWhen they put us in prison at first, simply for taking petitions, we\nsubmitted; _we allowed them to dress us in prison clothes_ ; _we allowed them\nto put us in solitary confinement_ ; _we allowed them to put us amongst the\nmost degraded of criminals_ ; we learned of some of the appalling evils of our\nso-called civilization that we could not have learned in any other way. It was\nvaluable experience, and we were glad to get it.\n\nA double triple in Thomas Babington Macaulay\u2019s speech to the House of Commons\non the Reform Bill, 2 March 1831:\n\nI will not, sir, at present express any opinion as to the details of the Bill;\nbut having during the last twenty-four hours given the most diligent\nconsideration to its general principles, I have no hesitation in pronouncing\nit a _wise, noble, and comprehensive measure_ , skilfully framed _for the\nhealing of great distempers, for the securing at once of the public liberties\nand of the public repose, and for the reconciling and knitting together of all\nthe orders of the State_.\n\nFrom an essay by Thomas Paine in _The American Crisis_ (1776), ordered by\nGeneral Washington to be read to the troops at Valley Forge a year later:\n\nSay not that thousands are gone, turn out your tens of thousands; throw not\nthe burden of the day upon Providence, but \u2018show your faith by your works\u2019,\nthat God may bless you. It matters not where you live, or what rank of life\nyou hold, the evil or the blessing will reach you all. _The far and the near,\nthe home counties and the back, the rich and the poor_ , will suffer or\nrejoice alike.\n\n\n12\n\nHow do they do it? Weight control\n\nEven good speakers and speechwriters can get triples wrong. This one of\nObama\u2019s was slightly flawed:\n\n\u2026 new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build \u2026\n\n4 + 5 + 4 [number of words]\n\nIt would have been more effective to avoid the passive construction and\nmaintain the parallel, producing a more dynamic impact:\n\n\u2026 new energy to harness, new jobs to create, new schools to build \u2026\n\n4 + 4 + 4\n\nThe passive construction always distances the speaker from the action. It\u2019s a\nuseful construction if you want to say that something happened but don\u2019t want\nto say who did it. That\u2019s why newspaper billboards, wanting to evoke curiosity\n(and thus get someone to buy the paper), tend to say things like:\n\n\n## TWENTY KILLED\n\nand not:\n\n\n## TWENTY KILLED BY UNEXPECTED TORNADO\n\nwhich removes the curiosity from a potential purchaser. But it can be a\ndangerous strategy in a political speech. To say that \u2018new jobs are to be\ncreated\u2019 similarly leaves the question open: \u2018by whom?\u2019 A political opponent\ncould pick on that and make something of it. It was an odd choice for Obama,\nseeing that the other two verbs in the string are active and dynamic.\n\nWhen the agent (the _by_ phrase) is expressed, there is another effect: it\nplaces the interesting part of the sentence at the end. The weightier bit of\nmeaning, in _Twenty killed by unexpected tornado_ , comes after the verb. This\nactually conforms to the normal way English clauses work in everyday\nconversation. The bulk of the clause (the \u2018weight\u2019) appears after the verb\nrather than before it. Which of these two sentences is more natural, easier to\nprocess?\n\nIt was nice of John and Mary to come and visit me the other day.\n\nFor John and Mary to come and visit me the other day was nice.\n\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer. Everyone would say the first was the more natural style.\nAnd this principle permeates English grammar. Most everyday sentences have a\ngrammatical subject that is just one or two words \u2013 usually a pronoun ( _I \u2026_\n, _We \u2026_ , _It_ \u2026) or a short noun phrase ( _My friend said_ \u2026, _The answer\nis_ \u2026). When it comes to easy comprehension, respecting end-weight is crucial.\n\nWe notice cases when the speaker fails to respect it. If a speaker starts off\nwith a lengthy grammatical subject and keeps us waiting for the verb, there\ncomes a point when we begin to lose track and start thinking \u2018get on with it\u2019\nor \u2018what\u2019s it all about?\u2019 This sort of thing:\n\nMy party, which has served you faithfully for the past five years, and which\nhas fulfilled every one of its election promises, and which is prepared now to\nserve you again if you put your trust in us, and if \u2026\n\n\u2018Where\u2019s the verb?\u2019 I shriek silently. Eventually it comes \u2013 if the speaker\ndoesn\u2019t lose track. (It\u2019s not unusual to hear such sentences where the verb\nnever surfaces.) But we have to remember how the sentence started in order to\nmake sense of the ending:\n\n\u2026 and if you place your cross in the right box on polling day, I proudly\nrepresent tonight.\n\nSometimes the speaker senses that the subject has been lost sight of, and adds\na reminder:\n\n\u2026 and if you place your cross in the right box on polling day, _that party_ I\nproudly represent tonight.\n\nBut even with a recap, the weight of a long grammatical subject can break\nlisteners\u2019 attention tolerance. By contrast, putting the verb first\nimmediately makes us more comfortable with the sequence of clauses that\nfollow, because we know where the speaker is going:\n\nI proudly represent tonight the party which has served you faithfully \u2026\n\nWe feel that the speaker is getting down to business.\n\nObama\u2019s speech is an example of someone doing exactly that. Here\u2019s the\nbeginning of all his sentences in one of his paragraphs, with the verb in bold\n(and ignoring the pauses). Simply note where the length of each clause lies.\n\nI **was** never the likeliest candidate for this office.\n\nWe **didn\u2019t start** with much money or many endorsements.\n\nOur campaign **was not hatched** in the halls of Washington.\n\nIt **began** in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord\nand the front porches of Charleston.\n\nIt **was built** by working men and women who dug into what little savings\nthey had \u2026\n\nIt **grew** strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their\ngeneration\u2019s apathy \u2026\n\nIt **drew** strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold \u2026\n\nThis **is** your victory.\n\nJust one or two words before the verb. That\u2019s not only conversationally\nnormal, it\u2019s excellent public speaking practice too, because it ties in\nclosely with the way speakers use the rhythm and melody of speech, where the\npoint of greatest prominence comes after the verb. I\u2019ll talk more about that\nlater.\n\nThe vast majority of triples make use of the principle of end-weight, as in\nthese Obama examples. The numbers show an increase in word length, especially\nin the last item:\n\n\u2026 two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century\n\n2 + 4 + 7\n\n\u2026 how they\u2019ll make the mortgage or pay their doctors\u2019 bills or save enough for\ntheir child\u2019s college education\n\n3 + 4 + 7\n\n\u2026 block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand\n\n3 + 3 + 5\n\nOther instances can be seen in the Thatcher, Brand, Gaga, and Suu Kyi\nquotations in [Chapter 11](part0026.html#ch11), and those from Pankhurst and\nMacaulay in the related Interlude. Note that the end-weight principle can\napply to single words too, with the number of syllables in the word\nincreasing, as in the Macaulay sentence:\n\nI have no hesitation in pronouncing it a _wise, noble, and comprehensive\nmeasure_.\n\n1 + 2 + 4\n\nSome triples don\u2019t make use of end-weight. They are perfect parallels, using\nthe same grammatical construction and containing exactly the same number of\nwords, as in the examples from Hillary Clinton and Thomas Paine. Obama uses\nthem too:\n\n\u2026 Americans who volunteered and organized and proved \u2026\n\n1 + 1 + 1\n\n\u2026 partisanship and pettiness and immaturity \u2026\n\n1 + 1 + 1\n\n\u2026 a government of the people, by the people, and for the people \u2026\n\n3 + 3 + 3\n\nTheir succinctness, of course, makes them extremely memorable, and prime\ncandidates for inclusion in books of quotations.\n\nI think everyone has an instinct for the power of an end-weighted triple. At a\nwedding reception, I remember this concluding sentence from a best man who\nsaid he had never spoken in public before:\n\nI hope you two have a fantastic honeymoon, a long and happy marriage, and have\nlots and lots of wonderful children that grow up to be as handsome as me.\n\nI don\u2019t recall anything else from the speech. And it may have been my\nimagination, but I felt other potential best men in the room were making a\nmental note: \u2018I can use that.\u2019 Triples do tend to stay with you.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 12\n\n\nMagical foursomes\n\n![Crystal](../images/00017.jpeg)\n\nFor parallel structures to work, the sequence must be capable of being\nretained in working memory, otherwise the effect will be lost. This is easy\nwith pairs and triples, and it\u2019s just about possible with fours, as long as\nthe elements aren\u2019t too long.\n\nHere is Winston Churchill: I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and\nsweat.  \nIn war: resolution.

Order, order\n\nAnother important feature of successful eloquence (or successful writing) is\nthe role played in comprehension by what is called \u2018order of mention\u2019. It\u2019s a\ncritical feature of good storytelling and clear instructions. And if it\u2019s not\nthere, you notice it.\n\nImagine you\u2019ve just bought a self-build kit from a store, and the instructions\ngo like this (as they often do):\n\nStep 1: Find strut A and strut B, and screw the green ends together using one\nof the screws P.\n\nStep 2: Find strut C and strut D, and screw the green ends together using one\nof the screws P.\n\nStep 3: Join struts A/B and C/D at the red end using one of the screws P.\n\nImportant: always ensure that, before you join any struts together, you use a\nwasher T.\n\nAt this point, having carefully joined the four struts together, you howl, as\nyou have failed to use washers T. You unscrew, grumbling, and start all over\nagain.\n\nThe manufacturer has let you down by not respecting order of mention. It\u2019s a\nprinciple that can be easily stated: say first what must be done first; say\nsecond what must be done second; and so on. In these instructions, they have\nsaid fourth what should have been said first. They have broken order of\nmention.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with storytelling. Most stories begin at the beginning of an\nevent and move steadily through to the end. We learn this before we even get\nto school:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a little girl who lived in a house at the edge of a\nforest. One day she left home to go to school. On the way she saw a beautiful\npink flower. She decided to call it Eleanor \u2026\n\nEnglish of course allows us to break order of mention if we want to, but it\u2019s\na risky strategy, as it makes the listener/reader think harder. Here are some\nexamples where the first thing that\u2019s said is the second thing that has to be\ndone or that happened:\n\nBefore you take the pills, read the accompanying leaflet.\n\nIn 1666 there was a Great Fire in London. The year before, there had been a\nGreat Plague.\n\nAnd in this example, the second thing that\u2019s said is the first thing that has\nto be done:\n\nYou should read the instructions after you\u2019ve read the introduction.\n\nWords like _before_ and _after_ switch order of mention. They make sentences a\nlittle bit more difficult to process. Young children don\u2019t learn to handle\nthem until after they\u2019ve learned the basic storytelling technique, which is\n\u2018this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened \u2026\u2019. We would\nnever expect a children\u2019s story to begin like this:\n\nOnce upon a time, before a little girl who lived in a house at the edge of a\nforest saw a beautiful pink flower, and decided to call it Eleanor, she left\nhome to go to school.\n\nIt\u2019s the same content, and actually uses fewer words, but it\u2019s hopeless\nwriting. And it would be hopeless speaking, if such a back-to-front style were\nused in the storytelling part of a speech.\n\nBy \u2018story\u2019, of course, I mean any narrative that presents a sequence of\nevents. It is far more than fiction, and includes lecturing expositions, life\nsummaries (as in a prize-giving or a best-man\u2019s speech), and the marshalling\nof historical facts, as in this famous example \u2013 the statement made from the\ndock by Nelson Mandela at the opening of his trial on charges of sabotage (20\nApril 1964). He strictly follows order of mention, as shown by the critical\nconnecting words (in bold):\n\nThe African National Congress was formed **in 1912** to defend the rights of\nthe African people which had been seriously curtailed by the South Africa Act,\nand which were then being threatened by the Native Land Act. **For thirty-\nseven years** \u2013 that is **until 1949** \u2013 it adhered strictly to a\nconstitutional struggle. It put forward demands and resolutions; it sent\ndelegations to the Government in the belief that African grievances could be\nsettled through peaceful discussion and that Africans could advance gradually\nto full political rights. But white governments remained unmoved, and the\nrights of Africans became less instead of becoming greater. In the words of my\nleader, Chief Lutuli, who became President of the ANC **in 1952** , and who\nwas **later** awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \u2026\n\nAnd so it continues. This is an eminently sensible strategy in a difficult\nspeech situation where a complex story has to be told. We can sense the extra\nload on comprehension if, for example, the last sentence had been:\n\nIn the words of my leader, Chief Lutuli, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize\nin 1961, and who had become President of the ANC in 1952 \u2026\n\nThis isn\u2019t just my impression. A great deal of research has been carried out\ninto the way people respond to such changes. People are presented with a\nsentence structured in different ways and told to perform the actions:\n\nA Press the green button and then press the red button.\n\nB Before you press the green button, press the red button.\n\nC Press the green button, after you press the red button.\n\nThey respond most quickly to A, less quickly to B, and least quickly to C.\nWhile such differences might be trivial in an easy-to-follow story, such as\nwhen telling a joke, they can become all-important when taking an audience\nthrough an intricate narrative, such as an explanation of a scientific\nexperiment.\n\nThe sentence about the Great Fire and Plague was actually taken from a history\nbook aimed at children aged around ten. Here\u2019s the whole paragraph:\n\nIn 1666 there was a Great Fire in London. The year before, there had been a\nGreat Plague. The fire put paid to the plague.\n\nI was in a classroom observing a teacher asking questions about the book to\ncheck on comprehension. When she got to this point, I suggested she read the\nparagraph aloud, then ask the class the following question and get them to\nwrite down the answer: \u2018Which came first, the fire or the plague?\u2019 She thought\nit was a rather pointless exercise, but she did it, and was amazed at the\nresults. Half the class thought the fire happened first.\n\nThat is what can happen when order of mention is broken. Comprehension is\nlost. And the misunderstanding may have consequences for later learning if the\nmistake isn\u2019t noticed and corrected. In this case, the reversal was signalled\nby the phrase _the year before_. If the children don\u2019t notice that, they\u2019ll\nassume that the first thing that was said was the first thing that happened.\nAnd evidently quite a few of them fell into the trap.\n\nIt would have been easier for them if the author had written:\n\nIn 1665 there was a Great Plague in London. The next year, there was a Great\nFire. The fire put paid to the plague.\n\nBut writers like to break order of mention from time to time, because it adds\nvariety, and avoids a style of \u2018this happened, then this happened\u2019, which can\nbecome boring. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, as long as they remember that\nthey\u2019re making their readers work that little bit harder to access the\nmeaning. Speakers need to remember the same thing.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 13\n\n\nThe great Q\n\n![Crystal](../images/00018.jpeg)\n\nThe importance of good sequencing in speech is referred to several times in\nthe writing of Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (see [Chapter\n3](part0010.html#ch3)). For example, we read:\n\nJust as the current of rivers is more forcible in a descending channel, which\noffers no obstruction to their course, than amidst rocks that oppose their\nbroken and struggling waters, so language that is properly connected and flows\non with a full flood is preferable to that which is rugged and\nfragmentary.[15](part0057.html#en15)\n\nLater in the chapter, he acknowledges both normal order-of-mention and the\nneed sometimes to depart from it:\n\nIt is far too exacting a proof to always place first that which is ordered\nfirst in time, not that this order is not frequently preferred, but because\nthat which precedes is often of greater importance and should consequently be\nplaced after what is of less.\n\nFor the humanist writers of the sixteenth century, much concerned with the\nnature of rhetoric, there was none greater than Quintilian. Erasmus went so\nfar as to precede his remarks on the art of instruction by a disclaimer: \u2018It\nseems a mere impertinence in me to handle afresh a subject which has been made\nso conspicuously his own by the great Quintilian.\u2019[16](part0057.html#en16)\n\n\n14\n\nHow do they do it? Variation\n\nOne of the things actors know is that, in a long speech, they have to leave\nthemselves somewhere else to go. If you put all your energy into the opening\nlines of a soliloquy, you\u2019ll find it trailing away into nothing before the\nend. Rather, start low and steadily build up. Or, divide your speech into\nsections and introduce peaks and troughs. Or, divide it into sections and\ntreat each section in a different way. Whether you\u2019re speaking at a rally or a\nwedding, the principle is the same.\n\nHere\u2019s how Obama did it. The middle-game of his speech has several sections,\neach very different in content, and it\u2019s the switch of content that motivates\na switch of style and renews the audience\u2019s motivation to listen. There\u2019s no\nrecapitulation or anticipation. It\u2019s string-of-pearls speech-making (Interlude\n9, p. 73). If I characterize each section by a single word or phrase, I\nimagine this wouldn\u2019t be far away from the writers\u2019 notes when they first\nbegan to plan the speech.\n\nSo, after the \u2018thanks\u2019 section described in [Chapter 11](part0026.html#ch11),\nwith its rhetorical lull, we get:\n\n\u2022a \u2018story of the campaign\u2019 section,\n\n\u2022a \u2018scale of the problem\u2019 section,\n\n\u2022a \u2018challenges to our nation\u2019 section,\n\n\u2022a \u2018new dawn\u2019 section.\n\nAnd with renewed political messages comes renewed rhetorical structure. The\ntriples return:\n\nI was never the likeliest candidate for this office. --- We didn\u2019t start -\nwith much money or many endorsements. -- Our campaign was not - hatched in the\nhalls of Washington; - **it began in the backyards of Des Moines** \\- **and\nthe living rooms of Concord** \\- **and the front porches of Charleston**. --\nIt was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they\nhad to give **5 dollars** \\- **and 10 dollars** \\- **and 20 dollars** to the\ncause \u2026\n\nAnd the pattern continues, with triple after triple building up momentum.\n\nThe \u2018new dawn\u2019 section used two time-honoured speech-ending techniques. First\nthere was a sequence of four rather than three:\n\ntonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not\nfrom the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring\npower of our ideals: - democracy, - liberty, - opportunity - and unyielding\nhope. ---\n\nThat slows the pace down. End approaching. And then there was an appeal to the\nfuture:\n\nThat\u2019s the true genius of America, -- that America can change. -- Our union\ncan be perfected. -- And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what\nwe can and must achieve tomorrow.\n\nDefinitely end approaching.\n\nWhen I heard this speech for the first time, I thought that was it. But then\nthere was an electrifying change. The end-game was still to come. And it took\nthe form of a story. Obama had definitely left himself somewhere else to go.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting a story at all in a victory speech. As I suggested in\n[Chapter 8](part0020.html#ch8), stories are an invaluable way of starting a\nspeech. They help break the ice. But there\u2019s no ice waiting to be broken in a\nvictory speech. So there was no opening story. And by the time Obama had\nfinished going through his string of pearls, I was expecting the speech to\nend. It didn\u2019t.\n\nThe concluding section was totally different in style from everything that had\ngone before. In one sentence he moved from the general and abstract (\u2018America\ncan change\u2019) to the particular and concrete:\n\nThis election had many firsts - and many stories that will be told for\ngenerations. But - one that\u2019s on my mind tonight\u2019s about a woman - who cast\nher ballot in Atlanta. -- She is a lot like the millions of others who stood\nin line to make their voice heard in this election - except for one thing: -\nAnn Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.\n\nIt was a risky strategy. He had just produced fifteen hundred words of highly\ncrafted rhetoric, with many vivid and emotive images \u2013 _from parliaments and\npalaces_ , _America\u2019s beacon still burns as bright_ , _the true genius of\nAmerica_. The audience is being brought to the boil. To tell an intimate story\nnow could have produced an anticlimax. But it didn\u2019t. Why?\n\nBecause the speechwriters had a trick up their sleeve. The Cooper story starts\nquietly:\n\nShe was born just a generation past slavery \u2026\n\nbut within a few words she is part of a new rhetorical build-up, first with a\npair:\n\n\u2026 a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky \u2026\n\nand then a stunning triple, with each element containing a pair:\n\nI think about all that she\u2019s seen throughout her century in America -- the\nheartache and the hope; - the struggle and the progress; - the times we were\ntold", "doc_id": "0ae0e747-f7d0-4b15-9536-9b2f19a21834", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5b840003eb697f52148cfbd5044508e27306eb50689452e65e2bb6789fcb0617", "extra_info": null, "index": 13, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 168635, "end": 182155}, "image": null}, "2929482231188363256": {"text": "beacon still burns as bright_ , _the true genius of\nAmerica_.

The\naudience has already shouted \u2018Yes we can\u2019, three times, at an earlier point,\nand they are expecting more. The catchphrase had been used throughout the\ncampaign. The real climax of the speech is waiting to build on that.\n\nBut an audience has to be taught what to do by way of reaction. People won\u2019t\nintervene en masse in the middle of a story. They have to be invited. And\nObama uses the rule of three to teach them. That first \u2018Yes we can\u2019 gets no\nnoticeable response from the crowd. Nor does the second:\n\nAt a time when women\u2019s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, - she\nlived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. - Yes we\ncan.\n\nBut after the third, the crowd knows it need wait no longer:\n\nWhen there was despair in the Dust Bowl and - depression across the land, -\nshe saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, - new jobs, - a new\nsense of common purpose. - Yes we can.\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes we can!\n\nFour more \u2018Yes we can\u2019 responses follow, the last one closing the speech. And\neach of the short paragraphs that separate the crowd\u2019s shouts begins with a\ntriple, like this one:\n\nAmerica, - we have come so far. - We have seen so much. - But there\u2019s so much\nmore to do.\n\nWhen these triples focus on events in Ann Nixon Cooper\u2019s life, they respect\norder of mention, as all good stories should. I\u2019ve added the dates to make the\npoint.\n\nShe was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge\nin Selma \u2026 [1955, 1963, 1965]\n\nA man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was\nconnected \u2026 [1969, 1989, 1991]\n\nThe final paragraph of the speech ends with a burst of triples, like a\nlinguistic fireworks display. I\u2019ll lay it out as I did earlier:\n\nThis is our chance to answer that call.\n\nThis is our moment.\n\nThis is our time -\n\nto put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids;\n\nto restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace;\n\nto reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth\n\nthat out of many, we are one;\n\nthat while we breathe, we hope;\n\nand where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us\n\nthat we can\u2019t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the\nspirit of a people: Yes we can.\n\nThe last big clause isn\u2019t as well structured as the others. There\u2019s a curious\ngrammatical dislocation between _met with_ and _those who_. But by this point\nnobody is caring about grammar. It\u2019s the vocabulary that counts, and with\n\u2018dream\u2019, Obama ends as he began. \u2018Dream\u2019 is a powerful word in American\npolitical rhetoric because of the way it was used by Martin Luther King in his\nfamous \u2018I have a dream\u2019 speech on civil rights in 1963. King isn\u2019t mentioned\nby name in Obama\u2019s speech, but he\u2019s there in spirit, from the beginning to the\nend. Obama\u2019s opening words link dreams to questions. His closing words link\ndreams to answers. The speech is a Martin Luther King sandwich, and it went\ndown very well indeed.\n\nIt has been called \u2013 by those who have no party axe to grind \u2013 one of the\ngreat political speeches of our time. It won\u2019t rank with the very best\n(without editing) because the \u2018thank-you\u2019 section particularizes and\npersonalizes too much. Gratitude to campaign managers and the like has no\npermanent resonance. But if the role of style is to get your content across as\neffectively as possible, then Obama and his speechwriters proved themselves to\nbe stylists second to none.\n\nGreat eloquence, however, can have a downside, especially in politics.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 14\n\n\nGoing beyond the rules\n\n![Crystal](../images/00019.jpeg)\n\nVariation points towards another great principle of eloquence: rules are there\nto be broken. To my mind, Martin Luther King\u2019s \u2018I have a dream\u2019 speech (28\nAugust 1963, reproduced as Appendix 2 on p. 228) is the perfect example of\nthis. What was it in the speech that allowed it to be called by that name?\n\nIt is a speech full of parallelism. Almost half of its eighty-two sentences\nring the changes on a common initiating phrase. Not for King the limitations\nof the \u2018rules\u2019 of pairs and triples. There is just one pair (\u2018We refuse to\nbelieve \u2026\u2019) and one triple (\u2018Some of you have come \u2026\u2019) in the whole speech.\nSoon after the opening words, we have a sequence of four sentences beginning\nwith \u2018One hundred years later \u2026\u2019. And then there is another four, beginning\nwith \u2018Now is the time \u2026\u2019. But these fours are very different from the\nChurchillian ones (Interlude 12, p. 100) because of their length, with up to\ntwenty words following the cue phrase. This in itself is a departure from what\nmost speakers do. But they are a foretaste of what is to come.\n\nThe speech steadily increases the number of sentences that are put into a\nparallel relationship. In answer to the question \u2018When will you be satisfied?\u2019\nKing gives us six parallel answers, with just minor variations in the\nphrasing: \u2018We can never be satisfied \u2026\u2019. Another six follows: \u2018Go back to\nMississippi, go back to Alabama \u2026\u2019. And then the extraordinary memorable\neight: I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American\ndream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true\nmeaning of its creed: \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men\nare created equal.\u2019\n\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former\nslaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together\nat the table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering\nwith the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be\ntransformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation\nwhere they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of\ntheir character.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with\nits governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and\nnullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black\ngirls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as\nsisters and brothers.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and\nmountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the\ncrooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be\nrevealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope.\n\nThis is daring parallelism, which virtually guarantees its memorability as a\ntitle. Apart from the remarkable number of items in the sequence, we should\nnote their length: two of the pieces are over fifty words each. You have to be\na very confident speaker to control such complexity. King manages it by a\nsubtle recapitulation in the first case (\u2018one day right down in Alabama\u2019) and\nin the second by using biblical phrases that will be well known to most of his\naudience (\u2018every valley shall be exalted \u2026\u2019). And he precedes and follows each\nby using brief sentences that give the listener (and perhaps also himself) a\nmoment of relaxation to take them in.\n\nThe speech might well have ended after the \u2018dream\u2019 sequence. But this is\nanother fine example of an orator who has left himself \u2018somewhere else to go\u2019.\nFor he caps it with a sequence of nine \u2013 not lengthy and structurally diverse,\nas with the \u2018dream\u2019 sentences, but short and punchy, with exactly parallel\ninternal structure:\n\nSo let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.\n\nLet freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.\n\nLet freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.\n\nLet freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.\n\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.\n\nBut not only that; let freedom ring from the Stone Mountain of Georgia.\n\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.\n\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.\n\nFrom every mountainside, let freedom ring.\n\nIt might have been called the \u2018let freedom ring\u2019 speech, as a consequence, and\nindeed some do refer to it in that way. But the \u2018dream\u2019 metaphor has\novershadowed it. Either way, what was heard on that day was the potential of\nparallelism exploited to an exceptional degree.\n\n\n15\n\nHow do they do it? Being natural\n\nFantastic political eloquence has its critics. If you are too eloquent, your\nopponents will accuse you of being facile, glib, only a wordsmith. \u2018It\u2019s time\nfor action from the man of words\u2019 said a headline in the _Telegraph_ (18\nJanuary 2009), and the writer went on: \u2018Barack Obama has a remarkable gift for\noratory, but does it mask a fatal indecisiveness?\u2019 The criticism was\nrepeatedly made throughout his administration. In January 2015, Carly Fiorina,\nan American business leader, later announced as a Republican presidential\ncandidate, told Newsmax TV:\n\nHe is a man of words. He has spent most of his life with words, speaking, and\nhe seems to fail to understand that talking and acting are two different\nthings. He seems to think that when he gives a speech, he has acted.\n\nIt\u2019s a widely used political ploy, to accuse your opponent of hiding behind\nwords. Here\u2019s Lloyd Bentsen, accepting the Democratic nomination for vice\npresident in 1988, being rude about Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration:\n\nAmerica has just passed through \u2026 an eight-year coma in which slogans were\nconfused with solutions and rhetoric passed for reality.\n\nAnd, in case anyone thinks this is a purely American strategy, here is Charles\nDickens, aiming at British MPs:\n\nOur honourable friend is triumphantly returned to serve in the next\nParliament. He is the honourable member for Verbosity \u2013 the best represented\nplace in England.[17](part0057.html#en17)\n\nThe practice continues today, to the point of clich\u00e9:\n\nTory-led Government has been shown to be all talk and no action. ( _Daily\nExpress_ , 20 December 2014)\n\nEd Miliband\u2019s Labour Party is all talk and no action. ( _Socialist Worker_ ,\n21 August 2013)\n\nUKIP are all talk and no action. ( _ConservativeHome_ , 12 May 2014)\n\nAnd so on. Any election campaign in any country will elicit such jibes.\n\nThe proverbial wisdom of generations takes up the theme. Never trust eloquent\npeople. Don\u2019t believe what they say. Words won\u2019t get a job done.\n\nBehind big words dwells a little soul. (Switzerland)\n\nWhere there is least heart there is most speech. (Montenegro)\n\nMany words, little sense. (Japan)\n\nTalk does not cook rice. (China)\n\nFair words butter no parsnips. (Britain)\n\nThe danger is present for everyone who tries to speak well, not just\npoliticians. It\u2019s possible for a wedding speech to sound insincere, or a\nlecture to sound thoughtless, if it\u2019s spoken in too smoothly loquacious a\nmanner. It can also place a strain on the listener. As Blaise Pascal said,\n\u2018Continuous eloquence wearies.\u2019[18](part0057.html#en18)\n\nSo, if this is an ever-present danger, can it be avoided? Are there ways of\nstopping eloquence drawing attention to itself and tiring the listeners out?\nYes there are. The trick is to make the speech sound more natural, more like\nthe language we would use in an everyday conversation \u2013 but not exactly like\nit.\n\nWhen we talk to each other in daily life, our language is spontaneous,\nunplanned, informal. It\u2019s not carefully crafted, as it would be in a formal\nspeech or when reading a prepared text. We hesitate, repeat ourselves, leave\nsentences loosely connected and unfinished, avoid being absolutely precise,\nand add tiny remarks \u2013 they\u2019re often called \u2018fillers\u2019 \u2013 that tell our listener\nwe\u2019re working out what to say or how to say it. Here\u2019s a tiny extract from a\nrecording of a conversation that illustrates these points:\n\nSo, we decided \u2013 well, I say we \u2013 Jane decided that we shouldn\u2019t go for a new\ncar this year cos cos \u2013 well to be honest, things are a bit, you know, tight,\nand although the old car\u2019s um sort of creaky at least it does still \u2013 go, and\ngets us about \u2026\n\nInformal conversational style is characterized by these fillers ( _well_ , _to\nbe honest_ , _you know_ , _sort of_ ), repetitions ( _cos cos_ ), hesitations\n( _um_ ), pauses in unexpected places ( _still \u2013 go_ ), and loosely connected\nsentences ( _so \u2026 and \u2026 and \u2026_ ). Some people try not to use them, believing\nthem to be a sign of unclear speech, but in fact everyone speaks like this to\nsome extent. Most of the time we don\u2019t even", "doc_id": "bdd68120-71d1-48b8-8f09-212b1e51d522", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "03993ce0ad484b3210dd79a2b9d5c3cb414fb39a3b89651552112022d3e680d1", "extra_info": null, "index": 14, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 182121, "end": 195352}, "image": null}, "3051570913064725075": {"text": "we \u2013 Jane decided that we shouldn\u2019t go for a new\ncar this year cos cos \u2013 well to be honest, things are a bit, you know, tight,\nand although the old car\u2019s um sort of creaky at least it does still \u2013 go, and\ngets us about \u2026\n\nInformal conversational style is characterized by these fillers ( _well_ , _to\nbe honest_ , _you know_ , _sort of_ ), repetitions ( _cos cos_ ), hesitations\n( _um_ ), pauses in unexpected places ( _still \u2013 go_ ), and loosely connected\nsentences ( _so \u2026 and \u2026 and \u2026_ ). Some people try not to use them, believing\nthem to be a sign of unclear speech, but in fact everyone speaks like this to\nsome extent. Most of the time we don\u2019t even realize we\u2019re doing it. Fillers\nhave been called the oil that makes a conversation run smoothly.\n\nWe describe speakers as non-fluent if they overuse these features to the point\nwhere they become noticeable, begin to irritate, and interfere with\ncommunication. It becomes distracting when someone says _you know_ or _I mean_\nor _like_ in every sentence, or even several times in a sentence. And it\nreally jars when we hear someone doing this in a situation where we expect\nfluency, such as on the radio. I recall someone being interviewed who was\nasked a straight question and who began his reply with something like:\n\nwell, yes, thank you, erm, that\u2019s that\u2019s a, you know, a really really\ninteresting question, because erm, you see I mean \u2026\n\nand he continued in that vein, with islands of content occasionally appearing\nabove the surface of the waffle. This is as far away from eloquence as you\ncould possibly get.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to see these features in a more positive light if we note the\nway they can individually affect the meaning of what we say. Compare the\nfollowing pairs of sentences, and you\u2019ll get a sense of what the _you know_\nfiller can do, for example:\n\nI think you ought to leave.\n\nYou know, I think you ought to leave.\n\n(The _you know_ softens the force of the statement. Without it, the sentence\nsounds abrupt, even aggressive.)\n\nI bought it in the shop on the corner\n\nI bought it in the shop \u2013 you know, the shop on the corner.\n\n(The speaker thinks that _shop_ will be clear, and then realizes it might not\nbe. Here the _you know_ acts as an alerting mechanism: what follows is the\nthing to pay attention to.)\n\nI\u2019ve just seen John and his friend.\n\nI\u2019ve just seen John and his, you know, friend.\n\n(Now the _you know_ is suggesting there\u2019s something special about the\nrelationship.)\n\nSo when I say \u2018make the speech sound more natural\u2019, I don\u2019t mean making it\nsound like an everyday conversation, with all the features present. I mean\nintroducing the occasional drop of informality in places where the crafted\neloquence might otherwise feel overpowering.\n\nObama does this several times in his victory speech. Indeed, his very opening\nclause contains two instances of a colloquial pause. If spoken in a totally\nfluent way, we would expect to hear this, with just two pauses to highlight\nthe feature of the sentence that is about to be used three times (see [Chapter\n10](part0024_split_000.html#ch10)):\n\nIf there is anyone out there - who still doubts - that America is a place\nwhere all things are possible \u2026\n\nWhat we actually get is this:\n\nIf there - is anyone out there -- who still doubts - that America is a place\nwhere - all things are possible \u2026\n\nWhat are those other two pauses doing? Obama has either learned the speech\nlargely by heart or he\u2019s reading it from the autocue in front of him. He has\nno need to hesitate, to break up the natural rhythm of the construction. But\nhe does, twice. Why?\n\nThe pauses help to make you forget that he\u2019s working with a prepared text.\nThey give the impression that he\u2019s spontaneously thinking of what to say. They\nhelp to hide the linguistic sophistication which, as I showed in [Chapter\n10](part0024_split_000.html#ch10), underlies the whole opening sequence.\n\nYou might think this is just chance. But he does it again at the beginning of\nthe next paragraph, and the next (along with a tiny stammer):\n\nit\u2019s - the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches \u2026  \nit\u2019s the answer - th that - led those - who\u2019ve been told for so long \u2026\n\nAnd it\u2019s especially noticeable in the passages where he needs to show personal\n(as opposed to presidential) sincerity within the eloquence. Here he is\npraising Senator McCain:\n\na little bit earlier this evening - I I received - an extraordinarily gracious\ncall from - Senator McCain ---\n\nWe get a pause before the name. There isn\u2019t one chance in a million that he\u2019s\nhaving trouble remembering the senator\u2019s name, so the pause here can\u2019t be an\nindication of a mental processing difficulty. Rather, it\u2019s hinting at emotion.\nWe all know what happens when we\u2019re trying to say something really emotional:\nwe pause and stammer a bit. There\u2019s a tiny stammer-like effect here too, on\nthe pronoun _I_. Good grief, these effects lead us to think, he really means\nit.\n\nThe impression of spontaneity continues throughout this part of the speech.\nThere\u2019s no grammatical need for a pause between an auxiliary verb and a main\nverb, or between adjectives and a noun. (We would certainly never insert a\npunctuation mark in such places in writing.) But we get both:\n\nand he\u2019s - fought even longer and harder \u2026\n\nthis brave and selfless - leader \u2026\n\nA little later, his wife is introduced:\n\nI would not be standing here - tonight \u2026\n\nAs is his grandmother:\n\nand while - she\u2019s no longer with us \u2026\n\nAnd the family:\n\nI know that - my debt to them is beyond measure \u2026\n\nNone of these pauses are actually required by English grammar, but they are\nhighly appropriate, suiting the mood of the moment, and conveying a degree of\nsincerity that words by themselves could never achieve. I\u2019ve no idea whether\nthey were consciously introduced or whether they were a natural and\nspontaneous expression of an emotion welling up on the spot. Only a recording\nof the speech rehearsals would resolve that.\n\nWhatever the reason, the effect is the same. Judicious pauses, along with a\ncautious use of other features of everyday speech, can enhance eloquence by\nhelping to hide its artifice and to introduce a linguistic empathy with the\naudience, who instinctively identify with them, because they recognize them\nfrom their own daily conversational experience. But the operative words are\n\u2018judicious\u2019 and \u2018cautious\u2019.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 15\n\nSounding, erm, eloquent ![Crystal](../images/00020.jpeg)\n\nRadio stations can be very aware of the way umming and erring turns off\nlisteners. When I was doing my _English Now_ series for BBC Radio 4, back in\nthe 1980s, I learned a new technique from the studio managers. They would take\na tape \u2013  \n[For those who have never known this pre-smartphone technology: _tapes_ were\nlong reels of thin plastic on which sound was magnetically recorded. They were\nplayed back on a _tape recorder_. You would edit the tape by placing the tape\nin a special holding device and use a razor blade to cut out the bits of\nspeech you didn\u2019t want to keep. You\u2019d then splice the pieces together with\nsome sticky tape. It took ages.]  \n\u2013 and cut out any really intrusive hesitation noises. It made the speaker\nsound quite fluent!\n\nI learned a new word, as a consequence. De-umming.\n\n\n16\n\nSounding \u2013 natural\n\nIn _The Ghost_ , the eighteenth-century satirist Charles Churchill describes\nhis character Trifle launching into a speech, and getting into trouble after a\nfew dozen lines:\n\nHere TRIFLE cough\u2019d (for _Coughing_ still\n\nBears witness to the _Speaker_ \u2019s skill,\n\nA necessary piece of art,\n\nOf _Rhet\u2019ric_ an essential part,\n\nAnd _Adepts_ in the Speaking trade\n\nKeep a _Cough_ by them _ready made_ ,\n\n\nWhich they successfully dispense\n\nWhen at a loss for _words_ or _sense_ ).[19](part0057.html#en19)\n\nA cough. A very useful device if you want to gain some thinking time. So is a\ndrink of water. These are natural behaviours. They\u2019re understandable,\nforgivable. They don\u2019t reflect on the speaker\u2019s eloquence \u2013 as long as they\u2019re\nnot done too often, so that they become an intrusive mannerism or an obvious\ndelaying tactic.\n\nThe same point applies to any use of informal conversational features. Their\naim is to reduce the impression that an eloquent speech is contrived, and thus\nnot sincere. But if they\u2019re used too much, they themselves become the focus of\nattention, and the effect is lost. This is why people become interested in the\nvocal conversational idiosyncrasies of politicians. If you support the\npolitician, you see these quirks as showing an honest attempt to speak from\nthe heart; if you don\u2019t, you see them as a pathetic attempt to hide a dismal\npolitical record.\n\nIn February 2015 there was a documentary on BBC Radio 4 called \u2018Read My Lips:\nWhy Politicians Speak the Way They Do\u2019. Jonathan Powell, the former chief of\nstaff for Tony Blair, went through some of the famous political speeches of\nthe twentieth century. The programme focused on the main tricks of eloquence\nthat I\u2019ve already described, such as the \u2018rule of three\u2019, and was illustrated\nwith recordings of Asquith, Macmillan, Reagan, Wilson, Blair, and others. I\nwas asked to listen to the recordings and make some comments. What struck me\nmore than anything else was the oratorical shift in the use of conversational\nfeatures from the time of Asquith to that of Blair. I heard none in the\nAsquith speech \u2013 presumably a reflection of the greater formality of discourse\nused in the days of early radio recording \u2013 but many in the speeches and\ninterviews of recent times.\n\nAll the features heard in Obama\u2019s speech recur, as this short selection\nillustrates:\n\nMacmillan: It\u2019s er quite an effort to try and put our minds back \u2026\n\nReagan: There\u2019s a - coincidence today \u2026\n\nBlair: I feel the - I feel the \u2026\n\nMiliband: You know - the other day I was in the park \u2026\n\nBlair again: [It\u2019s] not a day for sound bites really \u2026\n\nAs in the previous chapter, the way to discover what these features do to a\nspeech is to see what happens if the same phrases or sentences are used\nwithout them. What happens, for example, if we omit the filler _really_ from\nBlair\u2019s sentence?\n\n[It\u2019s] not a day for sound bites really.\n\n[It\u2019s] not a day for sound bites.\n\nThe sentence now sounds definite. No messing. And if Blair were then to use a\nsound bite later in the speech, it would be an open invitation to his\nopponents to accuse him of inconsistency. The use of _really_ avoids that\ndanger: it tells us that Blair doesn\u2019t want to make sound bites, but if he has\nto, well then all right \u2026\n\nThe quotation from Ed Miliband is another instance of the uses of _you know_\nthat I described in the previous chapter. Here the force is stylistic, adding\nan informal note. It\u2019s friendly and matey. Compare:\n\nYou know **-** the other day I was in the park \u2026\n\nThe other day I was in the park \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the vocal equivalent of him putting his arm around you or sitting down in\nfront of a roaring fire while he tells you what happened. All politicians use\nfillers like this in interviews when they want to elicit a sympathetic\nreaction to the point they\u2019re about to make. It wouldn\u2019t work with some\ninterviewers \u2013 like Jeremy Paxman, the filler-ignorer.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many features that we can manipulate in this way, but it\u2019s useful\nto know what they are, if only to avoid over-using them. The most commont ones\nare the \u2018voiced hesitations\u2019, as phoneticians call them, popularly referred to\nas \u2018ers and ums\u2019. \u2018Voiced\u2019 here contrasts with \u2018voiceless hesitations\u2019 \u2013 in\nother words, silence \u2013 that also interrupt the flow of speech. They\u2019re an\nimportant index of mental processing. They show you\u2019re thinking. Or, on the\nradio, they show you\u2019re still there. Silence, on the radio, is the disaster\nscenario.\n\nActually, silence can disrupt everyday conversation too. A conversation\nbetween two people only works when both parti-cipants are vocally active.\nWhile A is speaking, B is commenting, providing vocal feedback in the form of\n_mm_ , _uh-huh_ , _I see_ , _wow_ , _yeah_ , and much more. This is essential\nfeedback. If you try withholding it, remaining silent while someone is talking\nto you, the conversation will soon break down. The speaker will think you\u2019re\nbored, not listening, upset, or having a seizure.\n\nThe same point applies to the speaker. We don\u2019t expect people to stop in the\nmiddle of a sentence and remain silent while they think of what to say next.\nImagine you\u2019re talking about something that happened at an event and you\nsuddenly forget the name of the person the story is about.\n\n\u2026 and then she went right up to \u2014\u2014\n\nWhat do you do at that point? You\u2019re desperately trying to bring the name to\nmind, and it won\u2019t come. Your listener is looking at you. You can\u2019t just stay\nsilent. You have to find a way of telling your listener that you\u2019re working on\nthe problem. That\u2019s what a voiced hesitation does:\n\n\u2026 and then she went right up to erm \u2026\n\nAnd if, after that pause, you still can\u2019t bring the name to mind, you can then\nchange tack with fillers or questions:\n\n\u2026 and then she went right up to erm \u2026 oh dear, what was his name, you know \u2026\n\nA single use", "doc_id": "6d7a5723-3d51-4c5c-bf85-5cf5e94fea31", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "853622c897a3947182ea74dbef9e673c43baab148d5d94229aeb81a0cd3475a0", "extra_info": null, "index": 15, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 195405, "end": 208450}, "image": null}, "27004420896513982": {"text": "something that happened at an event and you\nsuddenly forget the name of the person the story is about.\n\n\u2026 and then she went right up to \u2014\u2014\n\nWhat do you do at that point?

But\nit does depend on where you place it. A speaker should never use it before\nmaking a precise claim, for example. It then conveys uncertainty where\nlisteners expect confidence. Lecturers or politicians will convey a better\nimpression of \u2018being in control of the facts\u2019 if they use the first of these\ntwo sentences rather than the second:\n\nThere will be a saving for everyone of 10.5 per cent.\n\nThere will be a saving for everyone of - erm - 10.5 per cent.\n\nAny of us, trying to make a point eloquently, will find the impact reduced by\nan unfortunately placed _erm_.\n\nWhat you mustn\u2019t do, especially in public speech, is repeat the feature.\nNobody worries about the occasional _erm_ when speaking, especially if the\noccasion is an informal one. But when used frequently, or repetitively, or in\nunexpected places, _erm_ s jump out at you and begin to irritate. If listeners\ncan hear the fact that you\u2019re thinking, the speech is hardly going to be\nthought eloquent.\n\nIrritation always comes when a bit of language is used too often, so that\npeople begin to notice it. It distracts listeners, which is the last thing you\nwant to do if you\u2019re trying to get a point across. And worse, it can make them\nwant to throw something at you. Worse, because \u2013 in the case of politicians \u2013\nthe consequence is not simply to lose attention; it may lose votes.\n\nA single _erm_ might not even be noticed. But two _erm_ s one after the other\nsound ponderous, and three or more sound positively idle-headed. Try repeating\nthis sentence, which I once heard in a political debate:\n\nThis was a matter for the - erm - erm - erm - minister to decide.\n\nThe speaker was beginning to sound like Big Ben.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just hesitant speech that causes this effect. Any word in the\nlanguage, really, can become an irritant if it is really used too often in a\nsentence, really, or in a paragraph where really all one wants the speaker to\ndo, really, is STOP USING THAT WORD. Really?\n\nExcessive voiced hesitation carries all kinds of negative outcomes, which are\nusually internalized by the polite listener rather than made explicit.\nImpatience is one. \u2018Get on with it!\u2019 \u2018Spit it out.\u2019 Incompetence is another.\n\u2018Do your homework!\u2019 Lack of professionalism is another. You\u2019d expect radio and\ntelevision announcers to be _erm_ -less, but the sad reality is the opposite.\nI recall a presenter on BBC News 24 \u2013 where they say who they are before\nreading the news headlines \u2013 even hesitate in the middle of saying his name.\nAs it were: \u2018The News Headlines at midnight. I\u2019m David er Crystal.\u2019 There may\nhave been a good reason for it. Perhaps the presenter was momentarily\ndistracted by something coming through in his earpiece. But the effect was to\nmake the speech sound amateurish.\n\nVoiced hesitation can also be a source of humour. I remember a sketch by\nAmerican comedian Shelley Berman, when he played an airline pilot addressing\nhis passengers: \u2018Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is your pilot,\nCaptain Holbrook. I just want to welcome you all aboard Flight 714 non-stop to\ner \u2026 errrr \u2026 \u2019[20](part0057.html#en20) The audience hooted.\n\nThe thing about mannerisms is that we notice them in other people and fail to\nrecognize them in ourselves. That\u2019s why it\u2019s an invaluable step towards\neloquence to get someone else to listen to your speech in rehearsal, or \u2013\nthese days, because it\u2019s so easy to do \u2013 to record it and listen to it\nyourself. Listen out especially for the items that really irritate people if\noverused \u2013 fillers such as _you know_ , _I mean_ , and _like_. The experience\nwill never be the same as when addressing a live audience; but rehearsal\nalways helps.\n\nI remember my BBC producer, Alan Wilding, doing this to me when I started to\nbroadcast regularly back in the 1980s. Apparently I would drop my voice too\nmuch when I got to the end of a paragraph, so that the final words couldn\u2019t be\nclearly heard. It was a simple matter to correct, to lift the pitch that\nlittle bit extra, and give the closing words a tad more energy. But I would\nnever have noticed the habit if he hadn\u2019t pointed it out.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunately something that is still prevalent in broadcasting. We hear\na really interesting piece of music, and the programme presenter says\nafterwards:\n\nThat was the Such-and-such Orchestra, under their conductor So-and-So, in a\nperformance of Symphony number 6 in A minor by [inaudible].\n\nOr:\n\nThat was the Symphony number 6 in A minor by Gustav Mahler, performed by the\nSuch-and-such Orchestra, under their new conductor Anthony [inaudible].\n\nThe pitch of the voice is high and loud at the beginning of the sentence, but\nthen a diminuendo sets in, with a lowering of pitch, so that by the end, the\nvoice is inaudible. I\u2019ve lost track of the number of times, in the car, my\nwife and I simultaneously howl: WHO?\n\nYou need to rehearse a speech beforehand in any case, to check on its length \u2013\nat least until you become so experienced that you can control your timing\ninstinctively. Or, if it\u2019s a prepared text, read it through aloud. If there\nare pictures to show, or a PowerPoint presentation to include, and what you\nwant to say isn\u2019t already in the written text, practise the commentary you\nexpect to make. It all helps to avoid the kind of disaster I described in\n[Chapter 4](part0012.html#ch4), where the speaker failed to keep to time.\n\nSpeaking impressively, but naturally, is the goal of eloquence. And to achieve\nit, speakers need to master all the elements of the speaking voice, such as\ntheir pitch level, their loudness, and \u2013 above all \u2013 their speed. If there\u2019s\none factor in delivery that affects listeners more than anything else, it\u2019s\nspeech rate. If the speaker is too fast, the message can be unintelligible. If\ntoo slow, it can be sleep-inducing. If exactly the same tempo is used\nthroughout, it can be boring.\n\nBut what does \u2018too fast\u2019 and \u2018too slow\u2019 mean, exactly? What are the norms for\neffective public speaking? People speak faster in everyday spontaneous\nconversation than they do when speaking in public. Just how much faster? How\nis a balance to be achieved? Understanding the way speed works when we speak\nis an important step towards achieving a natural kind of eloquence.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 16\n\n\n## WPM\n\n![Crystal](../images/00021.jpeg)\n\nIgnoring the opening \u2018Hello Chicago\u2019, the two hesitations, and the crowd\u2019s\nrepeated \u2018Yes we can\u2019, there are 2,040 words in Obama\u2019s speech. It lasts for\nsixteen minutes and thirty-five seconds. That looks as if he\u2019s speaking at 123\nwords a minute (WPM).\n\nBut that\u2019s a false measure, because he pauses a great deal (as the 462 dashes\nin the transcript show), and some of the pauses are quite long, especially\nwhen he waits to acknowledge the crowd\u2019s applause. In fact, on my rough\nstopwatch count, they add up to four minutes fifteen seconds. If we subtract\nthat from his total speaking time, we find an actual rate of 165 WPM.\n\nIs that normal? We need to do some counting.\n\n\n17\n\n\nRates of exchange\n\nWords per minute don\u2019t actually give a very precise indication of a speaker\u2019s\nrate, for the obvious reason that they are of different lengths. A speaker who\nuses lots of long words, such as _imagination_ , _fundamental_ , and\n_Afghanistan_ is going to end up apparently speaking a lot more slowly than\nsomeone using lots of short words. It\u2019s simple maths. If I speak at the rate\nof one syllable per second, and each word is one syllable, I will speak sixty\nwords in a minute (if I don\u2019t pause). If each word is four syllables, I will\nbe able to speak \u2013 depending on how quickly I say the unstressed syllables \u2013\nless than half that number.\n\nWords are not a precise measure, for that reason. And also because it isn\u2019t\nobvious what counts as a word. The CNN transcript of Obama\u2019s speech says _vice\npresident-elect_ , or should it be _vice president elect or vice-president\nelect or vice-president-elect_? One, two, or three? And what about _not-so-\nyoung_ and _221_. I counted _221_ as one word in my Interlude 16; but if it\nwere written _two hundred and twenty one_ it would count as five.\n\nSo, when phoneticians measure speech rate, they generally count the syllables,\nnot the words. A-syl-la-ble-is-a-u-nit-of-speech-where-there-is-a-per-ceiv-a-\nble-pulse-or-beat. It\u2019s a far more accurate method. On that basis, Obama\u2019s\ninter-pausal rate is 167 syllables per minute \u2013 not very different from the\nword-based rate in his case, but that\u2019s because the vast majority of the words\nin his speech (92 per cent) are just one or two syllables in length. He has\nkept it simple. (It\u2019s a side issue for the present chapter, but it\u2019s worth\nnoting that there are only thirty words that are four syllables in the whole\nspeech, and only eleven that are longer \u2013 words like _immaturity_ and\n_determination_. The vocabulary is well within the grasp of ordinary people \u2013\na point all speakers to a general audience should bear in mind.)\n\nNormally, in everyday English conversation, people speak (between pauses) at a\nrate of five or six syllables per second. One syllable per second, as in my\nmaths example, would be very slow indeed. In fact I\u2019ve only ever heard it when\nspeech therapists are teaching stammerers to use what they call \u2018slowed\nspeech\u2019 \u2013 a technique that can help them control their stammer. Try speaking\nat one syllable per second and you\u2019ll see how slow that is. Look at your watch\nand \u2013 say \u2013 this \u2013 sen \u2013 tence \u2013 with \u2013 one \u2013 syl \u2013 la \u2013 ble \u2013 per \u2013 se \u2013\ncond. Not even the slowest public speaker goes at that rate. Though I must\nadmit I did once hear an after-dinner speaker, who had had far too much wine,\ncome perilously close.\n\nAnd before I move on, note the reference to \u2018English\u2019. Languages operate at\ndifferent syllable rates because they have different structures and rhythms.\nThe number of syllables a Japanese or Spanish newsreader manages to cram into\na minute is far greater than the English equivalent. In a study in the journal\n_Language_ , a team of researchers found that in spontaneous speech samples\nJapanese speakers spoke at a rate of 7.84 syllables per second, followed by\nSpanish (7.82), French (7.18), Italian (6.99), English (6.19), and German\n(5.97).[21](part0057.html#en21) If everyday expectations are for faster\nspeech, it\u2019s likely that in public-speaking situations the speech will be\nfaster too. But even in one language there\u2019s a great deal of variation. Some\naccents of English are much slower than others, as reflected in the\nstereotypes of English West Country rustic folk and drawling Texans.\n\nHow fast you speak isn\u2019t only a matter of personality. True, some people are\nfast speakers, and some are slow, just as they vary in the rate at which they\ndo things and walk around. But a lot depends on where you live and the kind of\njob you do. Several research studies have shown that people in cities walk\nfaster than people in the countryside, and that people in prosperous countries\nwalk faster than those in undeveloped countries. Unsurprisingly, they talk\nfaster too. If time means money, then the more walking/talking you can get\nthrough in a day, the better. So the points about speech rate in this chapter\nshould be interpreted cautiously. Speaking at a lunchtime meeting in the City,\nwith everyone looking at their watches, is likely to prompt a faster\npresentation than one at the same time in deepest Ruralshire.\n\nFive or six syllables a second might sound fast, but it\u2019s a natural speed in\ncalm, informal conversation with domestic subject matter. Time yourself saying\na sentence of ten syllables out loud, such as \u2018Did you manage to catch the bus\ntoday?\u2019 Ten syllables. I just did it and it took me two seconds. Some people\nwould say this more slowly, some more quickly. But the average is five\nsyllables a second. If you\u2019re having a heated argument, the average will go up\nto seven or eight. If you\u2019re expounding a complicated topic, it may go down to\nthree or four. And if you\u2019re feeling especially meditative or tired, it may go\nlower than that.\n\nThe exchanges in everyday conversation are quite fast, therefore. If we spoke\nfor a full minute at the rate of five syllables a second we would produce 300\nsyllables. But we need to breathe. And our grammar makes us pause at various\npoints, especially at full stops, as well as between chunks of information.\nVarying our pace is important too, as I\u2019ll describe shortly. So when people\ntalk about \u2018300 syllables a minute\u2019, what they mean is that the various\npassages being spoken would add up to 300 if they were strung together without\nany pauses and without any changes in pace.", "doc_id": "5306dc58-aab3-4109-9db0-c7bfd0d6a6f7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cb7965a81a8bf15b4a24cd905d108c6def0f62260b19b42d600683393ae8e234", "extra_info": null, "index": 16, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 208432, "end": 221691}, "image": null}, "2140151049000132707": {"text": "you\u2019re expounding a complicated topic, it may go down to\nthree or four.

It\u2019s a convenient average which\nhelps us compare different kinds of speaking.\n\nSo what happens when we speak in public? All the circumstances I\u2019ve discussed\nso far \u2013 the size of the room, background noise, listeners\u2019 variable\nattention, the nature of the occasion, the level of content difficulty \u2013 will\nmotivate a slower delivery. Obama was talking at an average rate of 167\nsyllables a minute \u2013 and that\u2019s a normal rate for a speech in such an\nenvironment. It may seem slow, but in a large arena the words reach the\ndifferent parts of the venue at slightly different times. The lag can\nsometimes be heard in an echo of what the speaker has just said. You have to\nkeep the speed down.\n\nThe danger is always one of speaking too fast, even in a small room and with a\nsmall audience. Every self-help book on public speaking emphasizes this. Fast\nspeech can harm diction \u2013 that is, the clear articulation of individual words.\nSlower speech not only helps the listener process the words more comfortably,\nit helps the speaker\u2019s language processing too. There\u2019s extra time to think\nwhat to say next. There\u2019s more of an opportunity to draw attention to\nimportant words. There\u2019s more time to look around the audience. Pauses enable\nthis as well, of course, but pausing too much can be a distraction, as we saw\nin the previous chapter. It\u2019s the overall pace of the delivery that counts for\nmost. With an audience where English isn\u2019t the first language, it\u2019s good\npractice to start slowly before speeding up to your norm.\n\nThe principle applies even if you\u2019re reading from a text. Usually the task of\nreading aloud slows you down anyway, but if the text is one you\u2019ve read\nseveral times before, you can unconsciously speed up and leave your listener\nbehind. It\u2019s a common fault in announcements over a public-address system,\nespecially in settings where the same message is spoken day after day. I\u2019m\nsure I\u2019m not the only one, waiting for a train, to have missed hearing my\ndestination called because the announcer has gabbled the list of stations.\nAirports are generally better, and Toronto airport best of all (in my\nexperience).\n\nI was once asked to advise a ferry company on problems with their on-board\nannouncements. They\u2019d been receiving complaints from passengers that the\nmessages weren\u2019t intelligible, and because the content was often about safety\nand security procedures, the company was worried. As some of the speakers had\nnoticeable regional accents, the in-house view was that these were getting in\nthe way of understanding. But it wasn\u2019t that at all. The problem was simply\nthat the announcers were talking too quickly, without realizing it. Even the\ncaptains, in their welcome-on-board message, fell into the trap.\n\nI spent an interesting week working with staff to get them to slow down \u2013\nrole-playing announcements at different speeds so that they became more aware\nof the contrasts, getting them to speak in unison, and so on. The human\nresources manager at the time told me she saw an immediate and dramatic\nimprovement on board. For such an improvement to last, of course, regular\nperiods of training are essential, especially in a company where there\u2019s a\nhigh rate of staff turnover and announcements are made by European Union\nimmigrants with a faster rate of speech. If speech-training top-ups aren\u2019t\nmade, the bad habits will return.\n\nIf you want to develop a feeling for speech rate, a useful exercise is to\nlisten to the average rate of speech in a setting you know well, such as a\nfamiliar radio or television newsreader or sports commentator, and try\nimitating. There\u2019s quite a lot of variation, but studies of English\nnewsreading show that most presenters speak slightly slower than\nconversational norms, at around five syllables per second. That usually comes\nout at anywhere between 150 and 200 words per minute, depending on the word\nlengths in the text. Newsreading has by definition a high informational\ncontent, and words tend to be longer than in everyday speech. Sports\ncommentaries vary more because of their need to keep up with the action, which\nmay be as different as the frenetic vocal volleying of tennis to the leisurely\nmeanderings of snooker.\n\nSports commentaries are also linguistically interesting because they\nillustrate better than any other kind of public speaking the importance of\nvarying speech rate. When, in football, the ball is being passed backwards and\nforwards among the players, the rate is slow, reflecting the pace of the game\nat that point, and it speeds up as the possibility of a goal approaches. We\nuse the same techniques ourselves in everyday conversation, though not usually\nso dramatically. And eloquent public speakers play with rate all the time.\n\nWhatever our normal speech rate is, we can do four things to vary it, which I\nlike to describe in musical terms:\n\n\u2022allegro: a sudden increase in pace;\n\n\u2022lento: a sudden decrease in pace;\n\n\u2022accelerando: a gradual increase in pace;\n\n\u2022rallentando: a gradual decrease in pace.\n\nWe don\u2019t introduce these variations randomly. Rather, they reflect the content\nof what we\u2019re saying.\n\nTake allegro. Why do people introduce sudden bursts of speed into their\nspeech? The reasons are many and various. It might simply be that they think\ntheir speed of speaking is inappropriately slow, and in correcting this end up\nspeaking more quickly than they had intended. Or they realize they\u2019re running\nout of time. But there are usually good semantic reasons for allegro speech.\nHere are five. (I\u2019ll show the allegro passages in italics, and any lento with\nunderlining.)\n\n\u2022They want to make a parenthetical remark, which they don\u2019t want the audience\nto pay much attention to: \u2018The important issue \u2013 _and the previous speaker has\nmade a similar point_ \u2013 is this \u2013 how many times \u2026\u2019\n\n\u2022They think they\u2019re about to be interrupted, so they speed up to forestall it:\n\u2018\u2026 and that\u2019s the critical issue which \u2013 [Interviewer: \u2018But don\u2019t you think\n\u2013\u2019] which I really want to [Interviewer: \u2018Hang on a minute \u2013\u2019] \u2013 _no let me\nfinishbecause this is a really critical issue \u2013_ are we ready for a sudden\nincrease in \u2026\u2019\n\n\u2022They realize they\u2019re saying, or have just said, something unpleasant or\nunpalatable, or something that might be taken in the wrong way, so they speed\nup to get over it as quickly as possible and present new material that will\ncapture the attention of their listeners: \u2018\u2026 now I know mothers can be very\npossessive about such things, _though I know Jane\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t fall into\nthat category at all_ because just look at that cake \u2026\u2019\n\n\u2022They think of something more interesting that they want to say, so they speed\nup to get to the new topic as quickly as possible: \u2018\u2026 that surely has to be\nthe main factor \u2013 _though I mustn\u2019t forget to add, in view of what the\nchairman was saying earlier_ , that next week\u2019s meeting \u2026\u2019\n\n\u2022They want to avoid going into something, perhaps because they\u2019re unsure of\ntheir facts, so they speed up to get to the safer ground ahead: \u2018\u2026 nobody\nwants to see such a thing \u2013 _though of course I know there are all kinds of\nqualifications that might be made here_ but I think it\u2019s safe to say that the\nreally central issue is \u2026\u2019\n\nIn this last example, the allegro was followed by a rallentando on the \u2018I\nthink it\u2019s safe to say\u2019, followed by a lento in which the \u2018really central\nissue\u2019 was emphasized. This is a very widely used feature in political\ndiscourse.\n\nSpeech tempo is the primary feature governing the overall intelligibility of\npublic speaking, but it doesn\u2019t work alone. Along with pausing, it governs the\nrate at which our content reaches the ear and brain of the listener. If the\nright speed is chosen, listeners will follow comfortably. But just how\ncomfortably depends on how the stretches of speech are melodically intoned.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 17\n\n\nRattyspeak\n\n![Crystal](../images/00022.jpeg)\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to show features like allegro and lento in normal writing,\nwhich I think is why their linguistic function tends to be underestimated.\n\nWe can hint at lento by capitalizing. If I had written \u2018the Really Central\nIssue\u2019 at the end of the previous chapter, the caps would suggest a slower and\nmore emphatic articulation. And we can show the slowing down of a single\nsyllable using hyphens or extra vowels: \u2018Re-a-lly\u2019, \u2018I\u2019d faaar rather you\ndidn\u2019t\u2019.\n\nBut there\u2019s no conventional way of showing a speeding up,\nunlessIrunallthewordstogether or hyphenate-all-the-words. Writers tend to\navoid this for obvious reasons, and prefer to say things like \u2018John muttered\nrapidly under his breath\u2019 and \u2018\u201cYes,\u201d he said abruptly\u2019. But Ratty from\nKenneth Grahame\u2019s _The Windin the Willows_ is an exception, when Mole asks him\nwhat\u2019s inside a luncheon basket:\n\n\u2018There\u2019s cold chicken inside it,\u2019 replied the Rat briefly;\n\u2018coldtonguecoldhamcoldbeefpickledgherkinssaladfrenchrollscresssandwichespottedmeatgingerbeerlemonadesodawater\n\u2013\u2019\n\n\u2018O stop, stop,\u2019 cried the Mole in ecstasies: \u2018This is too\nmuch!\u2019[22](part0057.html#en22)\n\nIt would be too much to take in if a sequence like this were produced in\neveryday conversation. Unlikely, you might think? Not so. I have heard just\nsuch a rapidly spoken series of foodstuffs presented to me by a New York\nsandwich vendor. I had asked for the contents slowly, choosing item by item,\nand partly following his prompts: ham, tomatoes, mayo, rye bread \u2026 some dozen\noptions in all. As he gave it to me, he recapitulated the lot allegrissimo. I\ndecoded the last words only: \u2018\u2026 on rye\u2019. Sandwich-selling eloquence at its\nbest.\n\n\n18\n\n\nThe melody lingers on\n\nIntonation is the melody of a language. It\u2019s one of the first things we notice\nwhen we hear a foreign language or an unfamiliar accent \u2013 the pitch of the\nvoice rising and falling. We talk of some accents sounding \u2018musical\u2019, or some\nlanguages sounding \u2018sing-song\u2019. And we notice the unappealing sound of a\nmonotonous voice \u2013 speaking at one pitch level without any variation.\n\nEloquent speakers, by contrast, make the most of intonation, just as actors\ndo. And \u2013 recalling the point from [Chapter 1](part0006.html#ch1) that\neloquence is extra-ordinary \u2013 they do it by varying their pitch in ways that\naren\u2019t usual in everyday conversation. Next time you\u2019re in a place where\npeople meet, such as a cafe, listen to the pitch level of the conversations at\nother tables. It\u2019s low. People generally talk using the bottom third of their\nvoice register. And if they\u2019re making a series of statements in a \u2018matter-of-\nfact\u2019 way, most of the tones go in the same direction. Count from one to five\nin a completely unemotional way \u2013 or the other way round, like the Houston\ncount-down controllers do before lift-off \u2013 and you\u2019ll hear the routine use of\na single tone. For most accents of English, that tone is falling in pitch. For\nsome \u2013 such as many accents in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland \u2013 the\ntone rises. Children playing hide-and-seek usually count keeping the tones\nlevel until they come to the last one: \u2018\u2026 98, 99, **100** , coming, ready or\nnot!\u2019\n\nIt takes something special \u2013 an emotion such as excitement, enthusiasm,\nsurprise, irritation, or puzzlement \u2013 to stimulate higher levels of pitch.\nPublic speaking is one of those special factors. The desire to persuade or\nexpress conviction requires more vocal energy, and this translates into\ngreater variation in pitch and loudness. But it isn\u2019t just rhetoric that\nmotivates this. We mustn\u2019t forget the aesthetic side of eloquence. If a voice\nsounds interesting, people are more prepared to listen and pay attention. And\nintonation is the main way in which speakers can add interest to their\ndelivery.\n\nIt also plays a critical role in helping our brain to process what we hear. We\nsaw this operating in [Chapter 10](part0024_split_000.html#ch10), where it\nproved possible to remember much longer sequences of numbers (such as a phone\nnumber) by chunking the string into two parts: 3615 / 8294 /. It\u2019s the\nintonation that enables us to do this. The first four numbers are typically\nspoken with a rising or level tone on the last one; there\u2019s a brief pause,\nhere shown by the forward slash; and the remaining four are spoken with a\nfalling tone on the last one, followed by another pause. This is a very common\nspeech pattern: a rising tone followed by a falling one. Listen to someone\nreading the football results on the radio in the UK. Everton 3 / Liverpool 3.\nThe first team has a rising or level tone; the second team has a falling tone.\nIt\u2019s the combination of the two that helps us remember what\u2019s been said.\n\nIn these examples, the rising or level tone tells us that the utterance has\nmore information to come.

And this is the pattern we see governing public\nspeaking, especially in situations where the speaker wants to control audience\nresponse. Let\u2019s go back to one of Obama\u2019s paragraphs. How does the audience\nknow when to applaud in a long string of points like this? It\u2019s by using\nrising or level tones (shown here with the words carrying those tones in bold)\nto signal that the list is continuing.\n\nit\u2019s the answer spoken by young and **old** / -- rich and **poor** / --\nDemocrat and **Republican** / -- **black** / **white** \\- **Hispanic** /\n**Asian** / Native **American** / **gay** / **straight** / - **disabled** /\nand **not** disabled / - Americans who sent a message to the **world** / -\nthat we have never **been** / - just a collection of **individuals** / or a\ncollection of **red** states / and **blue** states / - we **are** / and always\n**will** be / the United STATES of America ---\n\nThe strong falling tone on _States_ shows he\u2019s done.\n\nBut you have to be careful, when using a list like this, as it can degenerate\ninto sounding routine. Shopping lists are like this. What do you want to buy\ntoday?\n\nI need some **eggs** / **butter** / **bread** / **milk** / **cheese** \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s an open-ended list. There are other things you haven\u2019t mentioned. You\u2019re\nnot bothered about remembering them all. It\u2019s a boring shopping list, no more.\nEach item has a rising or level tone, and the rate is constant. No one item is\nmore important than any other.\n\nSo, when naming a series of people, beware making them sound like a shopping\nlist. Votes of thanks are like that. You have to thank five people. Here they\nare:\n\nI offer my sincere thanks to Jane Jones / Mike Williams / Fred Smith / Mary\nMorris / and Ann Parry / for all the work they\u2019ve put into this event today /\n\nIf read with a rising or level tone on each surname, and a constant rate, it\u2019s\nlike a shopping list, or a station announcer\u2019s list of railway stations. It\ngives the impression that you\u2019re just saying the names for form\u2019s sake.\nSincere? It doesn\u2019t sound like it. Whereas, if you put a falling tone on each\nname, and separate them by a longer pause, it immediately gives them a\npersonality.\n\nIn many churches it\u2019s customary at a certain point in the service to list\nthose members of the congregation who are sick or who have died. It\u2019s a common\nexperience to hear readers going through the names at a rate of knots. When\nI\u2019m training church readers I make them say each name with a falling tone,\nfollowed by a pause. It gives the names an individuality, a presence. After\nall, if the aim of the exercise is to get the congregation to remember and/or\npray for these people, then they need to be given a fragment of time in which\nto do so.\n\nThese units of intonation have a single job to do: they give prominence to the\ncontent they contain, separating it from the rest of what is said. So, if I\nwanted to remind Americans of \u2018the enduring power of their ideals\u2019, I could\nsay them in a single unit, like this:\n\ndemocracy liberty opportunity and unyielding hope /\n\nin much the same way as I might say a phone number. That would be ineffective\nand maybe even demeaning \u2013 \u2018Not that boring old democracy liberty stuff\nagain!\u2019 I immediately give each one more identity and interest if I say them\nas a sequence of separate units with rising tones, ending on a falling tone:\n\n**democracy** / **liberty** / **opportunity** / and unyielding HOPE /\n\nbut it still sounds like a shopping list. To convey to the audience the power\nof these words, you have to say each of them with a falling tone followed by a\nserious pause:\n\nDEMOCRACY / - LIBERTY / - OPPORTUNITY / - and unyielding HOPE /\n\nWhich is what Obama did.\n\nThere\u2019s usually more than a single word in an intonation unit. In everyday\nspeech, these units are typically five or six words in length. Even if you\ncan\u2019t identify the pitch changes, you can certainly hear the rhythm in a story\nlike this next one. In each unit, one of the words is more prominent than the\nothers, and it\u2019s these that convey the main message \u2013 what the story is\nchiefly about:\n\nlast **Sunday** / I was coming back by **train** / when there was a horrible\nscreeching of **brakes** / and it suddenly **stopped** / \u2013 it was just outside\n**Crewe** / \u2013 I peered out of the **window** / and saw an engineer walking\nalong the **track** / looking very **worried** / \u2026\n\nYou could pull out the prominent words and they would give you the story\nskeleton:\n\n**Sunday** / **train** / **brakes** / **stopped** / **Crewe** / **window** /\n**track** / **worried** / \u2026\n\nThey\u2019re usually the last words in the intonation units.\n\nIf you say the units in that way, with the emphasis on the last words, you\u2019re\ntelling the story, certainly, but in a matter-of-fact way. It has no drama. To\ngive it some, you need to look out for places where it\u2019s possible to bring the\nemphasis forward:\n\na **horrible** screeching of brakes /\n\nlooking **very** worried /\n\nBy emphasising _horrible_ you show your own feelings about the event; by\nemphasizing _very_ you show the man\u2019s. It becomes your personal story, rather\nthan a newsreading narrative, and your audience becomes more involved.\n\nOf course there has to be a good reason for bringing the emphasis forward in\nthis way. There\u2019d be no point, for example, in stressing _engineer_ :\n\nand saw an **engineer** walking along the track /\n\nWho else did you expect to see? A ballet dancer? A horse? There\u2019s only a point\nin having intonation draw special attention to a word if there\u2019s a good\nreason. A contrast is always implied. The screeching was horrible as opposed\nto normal. The man was very worried as opposed to being mildly worried.\n\nEloquent speeches often move the emphasis about in this way. It\u2019s something\nthat happens in all languages, and the classical orators always paid special\nattention to it. The motivation to do so comes naturally most of the time. We\ninstinctively know which word should be the most prominent one. But\noccasionally, it\u2019s worth reflecting on which of the words in a sentence are\nthe ones you really want to emphasize. Personally, I think that paragraph from\nObama would have been more effective if, given the context, he had ended with\nthe emphasis on UNITED States of America. But what do I know?\n\nGood speakers don\u2019t overdo the intonation units. It would be perfectly\npossible for me to tell the train story like this:\n\nwhen there was a **horrible** / **screeching** / of **brakes** /\n\nThat seems justified by the drama of the moment. The separate units give\nspecial attention to each word. Now all three are part of the emotion of your\nmoment. But if you carried on like that, giving each bit of the sentence its\nown emphasis, the effect would quickly pall:\n\nI **peered** / out of the **window** / and **saw** / an **engineer** /\n**walking** / along the **track** /\n\nWhy give special emotional prominence to ordinary words? What is there about\npeering or seeing or walking that justifies it? You\u2019re making your listeners\nlook for special significance where there is none. A speaker like Obama can\nget away with a long series of short intonation units because each unit\ncontains some content that is emotionally appealing to the audience. It needs\na highly charged speaking situation to make it effective. It simply wouldn\u2019t\nwork in a context where there\u2019s no reason for such a build-up of emotional\nenergy:\n\nI\u2019d like to **thank** / the **members** / of the **Rotary** Club / of\n**Newtown** / for the **invitation** / to **speak** to them / **today** /\nabout the **latest** / **housing** developments / in the **town** / \u2026\n\nI say again: the normal length of an intonation unit is half -a -dozen words.\nThere needs to be a special reason to make them shorter.\n\nOr longer. A long intonation unit, with a single rhythm and no pauses, is\ndangerous, because \u2013 as seen in [Chapter 9](part0022.html#ch9) \u2013 you risk\nstraining your listeners\u2019 comfortable attention span. You wouldn\u2019t have a\nproblem in the Rotary Club sentence because the content is conventional.\nListeners know what to expect, so they can handle a forty-two-syllable,\nrapidly spoken intonation unit:\n\nI\u2019d like to thank the members of the Rotary Club of Newtown for the invitation\nto speak to them today about the latest housing developments in the town / \u2026\n\nBut you wouldn\u2019t get away with it in a sentence where there are several bits\nof new or sensitive content:\n\nI\u2019d like to thank my new mother-in-law for her generous present to us both of\na sports car and my best man for missing the home match today in order to be\n**here** /\n\nRather it ought to be something like (with possible audience reactions):\n\nI\u2019d like to thank my new **mother-in-law** / [cheers] - for her generous\npresent to us **both** / [aww] - of a **sports car** / [wow] - and my best man\nfor missing the home match today in order to be **here** / [laughs]\n\nThis is the domestic survival of the intonationally fittest.\n\nAnd the prosodically fittest. Prosody is a term familiar in the literary\nworld, where it\u2019s used to talk about the metre of a poem. In linguistics it\nhas a broader definition, referring to the way we can change the meaning of an\nutterance by varying its pitch, loudness, rate, or rhythm. All four dimensions\nwork together to produce the overall impact of eloquent speech. I\u2019ve discussed\nrate and pitch. How do loudness and rhythm operate in public speaking?\n\n\nINTERLUDE 18\n\nRounding a sentence well ![Crystal](../images/00023.jpeg)\n\n\u2018Playful \u2013 playful warbler,\u2019 said Mr. Pecksniff. It may be observed in\nconnexion with his calling his daughter a \u2018warbler\u2019, that she was not at all\nvocal, but that Mr. Pecksniff was in the frequent habit of using any word that\noccurred to him as having a good sound, and rounding a sentence well, without\nmuch care for its meaning. And he did this so boldly, and in such an imposing\nmanner, that he would sometimes stagger the wisest people with his eloquence,\nand make them gasp again.\n\nHis enemies asserted, by the way, that a strong trustfulness in sounds and\nforms was the master-key to Mr. Pecksniff\u2019s character.\n\n(Charles Dickens, _Martin Chuzzlewit_ , 1843\u201344, [Chapter\n2](part0008_split_000.html#ch2))\n\n\n19\n\nBuild-ups, beats, and breaks\n\nLoudness and rhythm go together, for what is rhythm but loudness with a beat?\nAs with rate and pitch, they have a double function: they provide the norm for\na speaker, and they can be manipulated to produce different effects.\n\nI talked about loudness level in [Chapter 5](part0014.html#ch5). Obviously,\nspeakers need to be heard, and if they have a naturally quiet voice,\namplification will help them avoid vocal strain. \u2018Speak up\u2019 is one of the\nworst reactions you can have when you\u2019re trying to be eloquent. Interestingly,\nthere\u2019s no opposite equivalent: one never hears \u2018Speak down!\u2019 And yet an\noverloud presentation \u2013 usually because the speaker projects too strongly into\na microphone \u2013 can be worse, because it can be painful, especially if you\nhappen to be sitting in front of one of the loudspeaker cabinets. It\u2019s another\nof the pre-talk checks you need to make, especially if you know you have a\nnaturally sonorous voice and the hall is not so large. Loud speakers don\u2019t\nalways need loudspeakers.\n\nMaintaining a comfortable level of loudness is a prerequisite, but that says\nnothing about eloquence. Loudness becomes eloquent only when it is varied.\nAnd, as with rate, we can talk about what is possible using musical\nterminology. There are six options, all defined with reference to the\nspeaker\u2019s normal level:\n\n\u2022forte: a sudden increase in loudness;\n\n\u2022fortissimo: an even greater increase in loudness;\n\n\u2022piano: a sudden decrease in loudness;\n\n\u2022pianissimo: an even greater decrease in loudness;\n\n\u2022crescendo: a gradual increase in loudness;\n\n\u2022diminuendo: a gradual decrease in loudness.\n\nThe loudness increases are the ones we most often encounter in public\nspeaking. They\u2019re virtually obligatory at the end of a strongly rhetorical\npassage, such as this one in Obama\u2019s speech, where there\u2019s a crescendo build-\nup over three clauses:\n\nI have never been more hopeful - than I am tonight that we will get there \\- I\npromise you \\- we as a people will get there \\---\n\nIf the crescendo has worked, the speaker needs the pause. The loudness level\nhas to be reset to the speaker\u2019s norm. And there needs to be a contrast soon\nafter, otherwise the effect of increased loudness will be lost. As with\nintonation units, speakers must never overdo it.

As with\nintonation units, speakers must never overdo it. And so it\u2019s to be expected\nthat in the next passage from Obama\u2019s speech we find a diminuendo:\n\nbut I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face -- I will\nlisten to you - especially when we disagree -\n\nQuietness can convey an intimacy that is even stronger in its impact than its\nopposite. When a speaker wants to say something really personal, piano can be\nmore effective than forte.\n\nA crescendo is particularly common in a rhetorical sequence of three or four,\nbut it has to be supported by the content. It works well when there\u2019s a list\nof emotive words or phrases, as in this build-up:\n\nthe enduring power of our ideals - democracy - liberty - opportunity - and\nunyielding hope\n\n_Liberty_ was louder than _democracy_ , _opportunity_ louder than _liberty_ ,\nand _unyielding hope_ loudest of all. Each element in this sequence is capable\nof bearing an unlimited amount of loudness, so that the gradual crescendo was\neffective. But if the three elements in a triple are equal in importance, then\nthe loudness level needs to stay the same:\n\nit began in the backyards of Des Moines - and the living rooms of Concord -\nand the front porches of Charleston -\n\nIt would have been inappropriate to increase loudness here, making\n_Charleston_ the crescendo peak, because the whole point is to suggest that\nthe three places equally contributed to the campaign.\n\nAs with intonation, maintaining a consistent level is a feature of eloquence\nthat applies to any speaking situation where there are lists, especially lists\nof people to be recognized or thanked. Loudness variation, whether increase or\ndecrease, needs to be motivated. There has to be a very good reason if one of\nthe names in a vote of thanks is spoken forte/fortissimo or piano/pianissimo,\nas it makes the name stand out. But in a speech as a whole there needs to be\nsome sort of variation if the voice is to sound interesting. A constant\nloudness level, whether loud or soft, becomes boring.\n\nAs does a constant rhythm. Rhythm is our perception of regularity in speech.\nEvery language has its own rhythm. French, for example, has a rat-a-tat-a-tat\nrhythm, with each syl-la-ble-giv-en-e-qual-pro-min-ence. Phoneticians call it\n\u2018syllable-timed rhythm\u2019. In English, most speakers have a tum-te-tum-te-tum\nrhythm, where the stresses fall at roughly regular intervals in the stream of\nspeech. Phoneticians call it \u2018stress-timed rhythm\u2019. Not all English speakers\nuse it. The English-speaking world gives us several examples of people who\nspeak English in a syllable-timed way. Much of the English heard in the\nCaribbean or the Indian sub-continent is like that. And it\u2019s a dominant\nelement in Caribbean-style rapping.\n\nThe important point to note is that stress-timed rhythm in everyday\nconversation is \u2018roughly regular\u2019. We don\u2019t speak in perfectly formed iambic\npentameters. There\u2019s a big difference between me saying:\n\nIt\u2019s time to go I think the taxi\u2019s here.\n\nand:\n\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day.\n\nBoth utterances have a stress-timed rhythm, but the two utterances have\ndifferent properties. The impact of the poetic line is greatest when the metre\nis respected. It forms part of a line-sequence where the next lines have the\nsame rhythm, and it is the steady rhythmical parallelism that contributes to\nthe elegiac effect:\n\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day.\n\nThe lowing herd wind slowly o\u2019er the lea,\n\nThe ploughman homeward plods his weary way,\n\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\n\n(Thomas Gray, \u2018Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\u2019)\n\nBut there is no such predictability in the conversational utterance. Whatever\nthe speaker says next need not have the same rhythmical structure as the taxi\nsentence. And there are various ways of saying that sentence which allow the\nrhythm to be broken up and lose its regular character, such as introducing a\npause before or after _I think_ , or a jocular tone of voice on _go_.\n\nEveryday conversation is rhythmically erratic, and this carries over naturally\ninto public speaking, so that the speech doesn\u2019t sound like a series of iambic\npentameters. But this allows speakers to introduce a rhythmical contrast, and\nwhen it happens it contributes greatly to the impression of eloquence. There\nare two options:\n\n\u2022rhythmic: more rhythmical than normal,\n\n\u2022arrhythmic: less rhythmical than normal.\n\nBoth variations can add extra meaning to a message.\n\nTo make a sentence more rhythmical, the stressed syllables are made a little\nbit more prominent (shown here in bold) and the utterance becomes metrical.\nThe movement may be reinforced by pitch jumps between the stressed syllables,\nresulting in a spiky or glissando effect.\n\nI **real** ly **think** it\u2019s **time** you **ought** to **go**.\n\nThe result is to make the utterance seem more emotional. You might be\nirritated (this is the third time you\u2019ve suggested it) or concerned (you\u2019ll\nmiss the train if you don\u2019t) or excited (the fans are waiting outside).\n\nTo make a sentence less rhythmical, the pitch, loudness, and rate all vary,\nand pauses intervene unpredictably.\n\nI **real** ly - **think** it\u2019s **time** you - **ought** to - **go**.\n\nI can imagine this being said with great feeling before a loved one leaves on\na long journey. There may be additional effects: the occasional stammer, gulp,\nor sob, perhaps. It\u2019s natural for rhythm to break up in this way when you\u2019re\ngreatly moved.\n\nRhythmic effects provide an additional resource for public speakers. Listeners\nimmediately notice when speech becomes more rhythmical or less rhythmical. An\nincrease draws attention to the words that carry the strong beats, and the\nphrases that contain them. So when Obama says\n\na government **of** the people / **by** the people / and **for** the people \u2026\n\nthe **heartache** and the **hope** / **-** the **struggle** and the\n**progress** / \u2026\n\nit\u2019s the rhythmical parallelism that is the basis of the dramatic effect. The\nphrases reinforce each other and the sequence becomes more memorable.\n\nA decrease has an effect too. If your aim is to make an intensely personal\nstatement, then a strong rhythmical beat would make it sound prepared and glib\n\u2013 insincere. By contrast, as we saw in [Chapter 15](part0034.html#ch15), a\nbroken rhythm reinforces personal emotion.\n\nI know that - my debt to them is beyond measure /\n\nAs with other prosodic features, it\u2019s important not to overdo it. It would be\nperfectly possible to add even greater emotion to that sentence by introducing\nextra pauses:\n\nI - know that - my - debt to them is beyond - measure /\n\nBut such a level of disturbed rhythm is best restricted to really intimate\noccasions, such as funeral orations. In other settings, where there\u2019s no\napparent reason to show emotion, arhythmic speech is more likely to convey an\nimpression of speakers being out of control or out of their depth, or just not\nbeing very good at speaking. It certainly doesn\u2019t give the impression of\neloquence.\n\nRhythm goes hand-in-hand with pausing, as the transcriptions show. This is\nsilent pausing, of course, not the filled pauses (the ers and ums) I described\nin [Chapter 16](part0036_split_000.html#ch16). Experienced speakers know the\nvalue of a well-timed silent pause. And they know that different effects can\nbe conveyed by varying the length of the pause. So what are the options here?\n\nThe basic unit of silent pause is a beat of the speaker\u2019s natural rhythm. If\nI\u2019m speaking in a regular \u2018te-tum-te-tum\u2019 way, then my default pause will be,\nas it were, a \u2018tum\u2019:\n\nte-tum-te-tum-te-tum [beat] te-tum-te-tum-te-tum \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the predictable pause we use between sentences, or when there\u2019s a major\ngrammatical break in a sentence:\n\nJohn got home very late last night [beat] the car had broken down \u2026\n\nThere are two important points to make [beat] the first is \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s also the default in a list:\n\ndemocracy [beat] liberty [beat] opportunity [beat] \u2026\n\nWhen I\u2019m transcribing speech (as in the examples in earlier chapters) I show\nthe default pause with a single dash. A pause twice as long I mark with a\ndouble dash. A pause three times as long (or more) with a triple dash. And if\nthe pause is shorter than normal, I show it with a dot.\n\nThe contrasts are subtle, but they can be very meaningful, especially in\npublic speaking. We talk about a \u2018dramatic pause\u2019, for example, when it is\nnoticeably longer than normal. It keeps the listener waiting, but not for too\nlong:\n\nAnd you know what he said? [beat] [beat] I can\u2019t go!\n\nA three-beat pause is always possible in such narratives, but the speaker had\nbetter be sure the wait is worth the extra silence. And \u2013 the same old story \u2013\nif the effect is overused, it begins to lose its impact.\n\nIn some contexts a long pause wouldn\u2019t work. We wouldn\u2019t expect one here, for\nexample:\n\nThere are two important points to make [beat] [beat] [beat] the first is \u2026\n\nThe long pause reduces the impact of the opening words. If the points are so\nimportant, we expect the speaker to give them to us without more ado. The\nlonger the pause, the more the speech conveys uncertainty. Maybe the points\naren\u2019t so important after all.\n\nBy contrast, a shorter pause than normal speeds things up:\n\nJohn got home very late last night . the car had broken down . I was on my own\n\u2026\n\nThis is breathless storytelling. The brief pauses convey urgency and\nexcitement. You can\u2019t wait to tell the story. But the quick-fire sequencing\nshouldn\u2019t go on for too long, and of course it needs to be justified by a\nworthwhile ending. Why the excitement otherwise?\n\nThis kind of story-telling is common in everyday conversation. It often means\nno more than that the speaker is in a rush. But in public speaking, a series\nof sentences joined by brief pauses is unpalatable. Listeners lack the time to\nprocess them efficiently. It\u2019s very difficult to remember the content of a\ngabble.\n\nSo I would never leave a brief pause in an example like this:\n\nThere are two important points to make . the first is \u2026\n\nThe content motivates a longer pause. Not only must the speaker take a deep\nbreath at this point; the listener must too.\n\nA deep breath. I meant that as a figure of speech. Some speakers might\nactually breathe in deeply. But would eloquent speakers ever want their\nbreathing in and out to be heard? Sometimes.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 19\n\n\nHandling hecklers\n\n![Crystal](../images/00024.jpeg)\n\nStatler and Waldorf heckling the cast of _The Muppet Show_ from their balcony\nseats A longer-than-normal pause can prompt an audience to do something\nunexpected. In particular, at public meetings it gives people time to heckle.\nThere\u2019s especially a risk in leaving a dramatic pause after a rhetorical\nquestion: Where are we going? \u2014\u2014 I\u2019ll tell you \u2026\n\nSome wag is bound to shout \u2018Home\u2019 or \u2018Down the pub\u2019 or whatever. To avoid it,\nthe pause needs to be kept really short, with a quick follow-up.\n\nI\u2019ve met several political speakers who welcome heckling, because they know\nthey\u2019re good at producing a riposte. So they build into their speech moments\nof invitation, deliberately leaving the pauses long. If nothing happens, they\nmove on. But if a heckle arrives, they have a prepared response at the ready.\n\n\n20\n\n\nParalanguage\n\nProsodic variation is the foundation of eloquent delivery. This is because\nit\u2019s always there. We can\u2019t say anything without giving it a particular pitch,\nloudness, rate, rhythm, and pause. But prosody doesn\u2019t exhaust the range of\neffects we can convey with our voice. There are special \u2018tones of voice\u2019 that\nwe introduce every now and then, and eloquence can make use of those too.\n\nWhispering is a good example. We whisper when we don\u2019t want someone to hear\nus. In everyday life, the occasions are often conspiratorial, sometimes\ngenuinely so, sometimes with mock seriousness \u2013 \u2018shhh, she might hear us\u2019,\neven though the person in question lives miles away.

It might seem unlikely\nfor whisper to ever have a role to play on the public stage, but I\u2019ve often\nheard the mock effect, and used it myself.\n\nI mentioned in [Chapter 8](part0020.html#ch8) that I sometimes give a lecture\ncalled \u2018The Future of Englishes\u2019. At one point I talk about how the rise of\nEnglish as a global language is a relatively recent phenomenon. I refer to the\n1580s, when people were saying that English was a worthless language because\n(a) it was useless to travellers abroad and (b) it didn\u2019t have a literature\nworth reading. When I develop the literary point, I say something like this:\n\nWhat a bad time to be saying such a thing! We don\u2019t have many facts to go on,\nbut one thing we do know is that in November 1582 a young man from Stratford-\nupon-Avon got married. The belief is that he then travelled to London for a\ncareer as a poet, actor, and playwright. And, if the latest research is to be\nbelieved, he spent one night with Gwyneth Paltrow, and as a result wrote\n_Romeo and Juliet_. \u2014\u2014\n\nI usually move closer to the audience when saying \u2018if the latest research is\nto be believed\u2019, look conspiratorial, whisper the underlined bit, and say the\nfinal clause at normal loudness, ending with a crescendo.\n\nIt gets a good laugh. You can hear the audience reaction online in various\nversions of the talk. It\u2019s a slightly naughty joke, so the conspiratorial\neffect is appropriate. Audiences who have asked to hear this lecture are\nlikely to know the movie _Shakespeare in Love_ , and have heard of the star,\nso they get the joke straight away. And in case there are some who haven\u2019t, I\nadd a brief comment about the movie, and suggest they watch it.\n\nWhisper is an example of what phoneticians call a \u2018para-linguistic\u2019 feature.\nIt\u2019s an isolated effect that is at the edge of language ( _para_ means \u2018above\u2019\nor \u2018beyond\u2019, as in _parachute_ ). It\u2019s not like the pitch movements we use,\nwhich operate as a system of contrasts. It\u2019s just \u2013 whisper. Nor is it a\nparticularly English feature. Whisper goes above and beyond any one language.\nExactly the same effect could appear in French or Swahili or, I suppose, any\nlanguage. (There may well be languages where people never whisper, but I don\u2019t\nknow of any.)\n\nThere aren\u2019t many paralinguistic features, but when they do occur they\u2019re\ninstantly recognizable and they immediately alter the tone of what\u2019s being\nsaid. Audible breath is another. A breathy voice is one that is approaching\nwhisper but not quite getting there. You hear it most often when someone\nspeaks after running or doing some violent exercise. The words are heard\nbreathily within the puffing and panting.\n\nThat\u2019s a biological reason for breathy voice. There can be a linguistic reason\ntoo, when we\u2019re not out of breath but deliberately adding some extra breath to\nwhat we\u2019re saying, for effect. If I say \u2018Oh yes\u2019 in my normal full voice, it\nmeans what it says. If I say it in a breathy voice, I show greater emotional\ninvolvement. Some female film stars used to do this quite a lot on screen.\n(I\u2019ve no idea if they spoke like that at home.) There\u2019s actually a web page on\nthe Internet Movie Database headed \u2018Women With Soft Breathy Voices\u2019. Top of\nthe list are Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield.\n\nBreathy effects are rare in public speaking, but they can be used to dramatic\neffect. I remember listening to a talk by a doctor who was pointing out the\ndangers of sunburn. He had just returned from a holiday abroad and had seen a\nbeach, he said, where \u2018some of the people were sunburnt all over\u2019. If had said\nthis in his normal voice it would have been a simple statement of fact, and\nnot especially memorable. But what he actually did was lean his head forward,\nopen his eyes wide, as if in surprise, and made the last two words strongly\nbreathy. They \u2018were sunburnt ALL OVER\u2019. They really were sunburnt! The\naudience remembered that. I still do, years later, although I can\u2019t recall a\nword of the rest of the talk.\n\nOther paralinguistic effects include constricting the throat a little to\nproduce a husky or hoarse voice. That can express disparagement. You might add\na touch of nasality or a creaky voice or extra resonance. Most noticeable of\nall is speaking through a spasmodic articulation, as when you laugh, giggle,\nsob, or cry while talking. Again, these effects are unusual in public\nspeaking, but when they occur they\u2019re highly effective. Imagine a speaker\nfighting off tears or laughing in an apparently uncontrolled way \u2013 corpsing.\nThe audience is immediately involved. The crying and laughing can be\ncontagious.\n\nNote I say \u2018apparently\u2019. The emotions may bubble up naturally and sincerely,\nor they may be a controlled effect. Actors learn how to switch these effects\non and off. Public speakers can do the same. Is the laugh that suddenly\naccompanies a story that the speaker has told many times before genuine?\nProbably not. But the effect on the audience is the same as if it were. The\nspeaker has made them _feel_. A widely quoted observation attributed to author\nMaya Angelou captures the point well: \u2018People will forget what you said,\npeople will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made\nthem feel.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s no graphic convention to show paralinguistic effects. All a novelist,\nfor example, can do is write such things as \u2018Jane replied breathily\u2019 and \u2018Mike\nsaid in a seductively husky voice\u2019, and rely on the reader to recognize the\neffect and interpret the sentence accordingly. And the same applies to non-\nfiction writers. It might take a whole paragraph to describe a particular\neffect when in an audio recording it would be there in an instant. That\u2019s why\nI made so much use of the Obama speech earlier. If my description of his\neloquence was unclear, it\u2019s a simple matter to find the speech online and\nrelate my account to what actually happened.\n\nEach of the effects I\u2019ve so far described has a second dimension. I \u2018looked\nconspiratorial\u2019. The doctor leaned his head forward and opened his eyes wide.\nThe effects are visual as well as auditory. Corpsing doesn\u2019t come across so\nwell on the radio. The two dimensions complement each other. And because of\nthis, the visual element of communication \u2013 facial expressions, eye contact,\nbody movement, gestures \u2013 are also often brought into the term \u2018paralanguage\u2019.\n\nAny book on public speaking will extend the mantra \u2018It ain\u2019t what you say but\nthe way that you say it\u2019 a stage further: \u2018It ain\u2019t what you say nor the way\nthat you say it but the way that you look when you say it.\u2019 Some go into all\naspects of appearance as a result \u2013 such as the clothes you wear and the\naccessories you use \u2013 but for me the aspects of visual communication to\nconcentrate on are those that directly affect the linguistic features of a\nspeech. If there is to be eloquent spoken language, the accompanying body\nlanguage needs to be eloquent too.\n\nVisual eloquence doesn\u2019t mean gesturing all over the place. That can be\ndistracting. It means using the body to reinforce the point you\u2019re making. The\nreinforcement can enhance the message, as in the conspiratorial example. It\ncan contradict the message, in an ironic way. \u2018I\u2019m really impressed by what\nthe Tories are saying,\u2019 someone (not a Tory) said in a TV interview during an\nelection campaign. But the straight face, the downward curl of the mouth, the\ndepressed shoulders, and the flat tone of voice said exactly the opposite.\n\nGestures don\u2019t work so well in some contexts. In an interview, they can appear\ndefensive or even aggressive. If you\u2019re in a small room, they can seem\ndisproportionate. And if you\u2019re being filmed, that effect can be even\nstronger. If the camera is showing you in close-up most of the time, they can\nbe intrusive. It\u2019s very noticeable that in Obama\u2019s speech his hand gestures\nare minimal, emphasizing only the important words.\n\nWhat you do notice straight away, when you look at a recording of that speech,\nis his head movement. He repeatedly looks from side to side, taking in the\nwhole arena. And this is a strategy that any public speaker should also use. I\nremember a church service where I was sitting halfway down on the preacher\u2019s\nright, and he looked only at the people on his left. I felt totally left out.\nWith all speakers, I want to feel that they know I\u2019m part of their audience.\nAnd the only way for that to happen is for the speaker to look in my direction\nfrom time to time.\n\nNote, I say \u2018look in my direction\u2019. I don\u2019t mean \u2018look at me\u2019. I don\u2019t want\nthe preacher gazing directly at me when he intones \u2018Thou shalt not bear false\nwitness.\u2019 And if, a few seconds later, he went on with \u2018Thou shalt not commit\nadultery,\u2019 and looked at me again, I\u2019d begin to wonder whether he knew\nsomething I didn\u2019t. When people talk about making eye contact with an\naudience, then, they don\u2019t mean eye contact. They mean: give the impression of\neye contact. This is best done by looking around the audience as you speak,\nand looking slightly above them. I tell people to find a feature at the back\nof the room, just above the heads of the people at the back \u2013 such as a clock\nor a picture \u2013 and use that as their focal point. From the audience\u2019s point of\nview, wherever you sit, it appears you are looking at them.\n\nIt\u2019s very tempting to look at individual members of the audience, especially\nin a small room. You\u2019re making your points well (you hope) and the lady at the\nend of the second row is nodding appreciatively. So you keep looking at her.\nShe may appreciate your recognition of her support, but the rest of the\naudience won\u2019t. You can lose an audience that way.\n\nBut the best way to lose an audience is to turn your back on them. You might\nthink this is unlikely ever to happen, but you\u2019d be surprised. I quite often\nsee speakers with a screen behind them turn to look at the screen while they\ntalk about what\u2019s on their slide. It immediately severs the connection with\nthe audience. They lose what is being conveyed by facial expression. They may\nalso find it more difficult to hear what\u2019s being said. Turning slightly to one\nside to refer to the screen is enough to draw attention to the visual content.\nBut don\u2019t turn so much that your face is hidden. Look how the weather\nforecasters do it on TV, with a map of the weather behind them. They turn\ntowards it, and gesture towards it, but you always see their face.\n\nOf course, because this is such a fundamental rule of public speaking, it can\nbe hugely effective if there\u2019s an opportunity to break it. But the timing has\nto be right. I remember a talk where a speaker made a particularly\ncontroversial point, the audience reacted vocally, so he turned his back,\ncrouched down a little, and put his hands behind his head in a mock-self-\nprotective gesture. Everyone laughed, and he got more sympathy that way than\nif he\u2019d carried on full-face.\n\nI read an article once on public speaking called \u2018Mind Your Language\u2019. True\nenough. But you have to mind your paralanguage \u2013 including your body language\n\u2013 too.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 20\n\n\nThe UX of content\n\n![Crystal](../images/00025.jpeg)\n\nUX is business-speak for \u2018user experience\u2019.\n\nIn February 2015, Doug Kessler, the co-founder and creative director of\nVelocity, gave a keynote address at the TFM&A (Technology for Marketing and\nAdvertising) event at Olympia National in London. He began by asking the\nquestion: \u2018Why do you think people are so afraid of emotion in B2B?\u2019 (B2B, or\nbusiness-to-business, refers to commercial transactions between businesses,\nsuch as between a manufacturer and a wholesaler, or between a wholesaler and a\nretailer.)\n\nHe argued that, because of the social, personal, and financial risks in the\ndecision-making process in B2B, it\u2019s an emotionally fraught process. People\nshouldn\u2019t think of the B2B buyer as simply a decision-making unit, but as a\nhuman being. Treat them as such and you get a better result. And the best way\nof showing them you\u2019re human too, he said, was through tone of voice, as this\nconveys your intentions, personality, and (brand) identity more directly than\nany other aspect of language.\n\nKessler was applying the notion of \u2018tone of voice\u2019 to written presentations,\nand to the whole business of how a brand appears in public, but his remarks\napply with even greater force to oral ones. Tone of voice, he went on:\n\nhas to carry a hugely important set of messages between the lines, so it is\ndisproportionately powerful. It\u2019s a force-multiplier and a budget-multiplier,\nliterally. It can sap away your budget depending on whether it\u2019s bland and\ndull. Or it can add hundreds of pounds worth of value if it has attitude and\nspeed and it\u2019s fun to read. It\u2019s also a hugely underrated aspect of marketing\nin general, and certainly content marketing.\n\nTone of voice, he summarized, is \u2018the UX of content\u2019. It\u2019s what people\nremember. Eloquence, it seems, pays.\n\n\n21\n\n\nMind your technology\n\nThere\u2019s only one basic principle all speakers need to respect when it comes to\npreparing a speech that makes use of technology: prepare it on the assumption\nthat the equipment won\u2019t work. We\u2019re supposed to be living in a technological\nage, but I wonder sometimes \u2026\n\nI\u2019m talking here about problems relating to visual aids technology, rather\nthan", "doc_id": "ca995a3e-e95e-43b3-8e87-ef8d3093aa5e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4b17ff6fd8341a66b1c56c20eb05423b77e45104607c865e83621c0bb09918bb", "extra_info": null, "index": 20, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 261213, "end": 274598}, "image": null}, "166749839826629207": {"text": "it can add hundreds of pounds worth of value if it has attitude and\nspeed and it\u2019s fun to read.

We\u2019re supposed to be living in a technological\nage, but I wonder sometimes \u2026\n\nI\u2019m talking here about problems relating to visual aids technology, rather\nthan those relating to the use of a microphone which I described in [Chapter\n5](part0014.html#ch5). It can happen to the best of us. Technology treats\neveryone with equal disdain, and has no respect for the great and the good. In\n2008, Senator Obama was on the campaign trail when his teleprompter suddenly\nbroke down. It resulted in a hugely arhythmic and incoherent few moments.\nPolitical opponents, of course, were delighted, as it reinforced their\ncontention that this was not only a man of \u2018words not deeds\u2019, but a man for\nwhom even the words were a sham.\n\nIt may appear to be stating the obvious to arrive in good time to check that\nthe technology works; but it\u2019s surprising how often this proves difficult to\narrange \u2013 usually because the room is being used by someone else immediately\nbeforehand. And there\u2019s a less obvious problem. You need to carry out your\ncheck before the audience begins to enter the room \u2013 something organizers\noften fail to appreciate. If you want your slides to have an impact, you don\u2019t\nwant them seen in advance of the presentation. That can be difficult to\narrange too, especially if an impatient audience is wanting to come in out of\nthe rain.\n\nProblems are often of management rather than malfunction. I remember attending\na conference where the keynote speaker brought a large pile of transparencies\nto use during his talk. Before he began, he checked their order and placed\nthem carefully next to the projector. As he prepared to show his first\ntransparency, he realized the projector hadn\u2019t been switched on. He pressed\nthe switch, the fan started up \u2013 and promptly blew his transparencies all over\nthe front rows. It\u2019s difficult to regain composure and maintain a modicum of\neloquence after such a happening.\n\nSpeakers have to be prepared for such eventualities. An alternative\ncharacterization of eloquence is being able to cope with the unexpected while\nyou\u2019re speaking. A talk should be able to survive even the worst of technical\nbreakdowns. The operative word in this chapter is \u2018visual _aids_ \u2019. The focus\nremains \u2013 or should remain \u2013 on the medium of speech. The visuals should\ncontribute to eloquence, not conflict with it. Things can start to go wrong\nwhen speakers treat their visuals as a replacement for what they\u2019re saying, or\nmake themselves totally dependent on them.\n\nThe principle underlying the use of visual aids is psychologically well\ngrounded. People are likely to understand and remember more of a message if\nvisual memory reinforces auditory memory. Research studies suggest that, three\ndays after a solely oral/aural presentation, people recall about ten per cent\nof what was said; but if there has been a visual element in the presentation,\nthis figure rises to a remarkable sixty per cent or more. However, for this to\nhappen, careful thought has to be given to how the two mediums complement each\nother.\n\nIf photographs or other pictorial materials are being presented, with no\nlinguistic text at all, the timing is critical, because the appearance of a\npicture immediately dominates anything being spoken. Controlling the projector\nyourself can help you get the timing exactly right; otherwise you need to\nagree a method of instruction with the operator (\u2018Next slide, please\u2019). Every\npicture needs its introduction. And when a picture goes up, it\u2019s wise to\npause, to give the audience a chance to absorb it, before providing any\nfurther commentary about why it\u2019s there. A common failing is to have too many\nslides \u2013 a maximum of a slide a minute is often recommended \u2013 and to leave\nthem up for too long. If they remain visible after you\u2019ve finished talking\nabout them, they become a distraction. Inserting a blank slide before the next\nillustration is an easy solution.\n\nThere are certain obvious requirements, but it\u2019s surprising how often they\u2019re\nnot respected. The room needs to be blacked out, otherwise the audience will\nsee nothing but a series of ghostly images. The slides have to be visible from\nall parts of the room \u2013 something that in local venues, such as parish halls\nor a hotel dining room, may not be possible to achieve. And if there is text\nrather than a picture, it has to be legible to those seated farthest away. The\ntype size has to be large enough to be read, and this reduces the amount of\ninformation you can get onto the slide. The most legible slides are those that\ncontain no more than three or four short points.\n\nAs with pictures, the audience needs time to absorb what is written. A slide\nimmediately takes audience attention away from the voice, so there is no point\nin saying something critical at this juncture. There also needs to be a brief\npause before you address what is on the slide, because people find it very\ndifficult to process conflicting channels of linguistic information at the\nsame time. We sometimes hear a protest in a multi-party conversation or panel\ndiscussion: \u2018One at a time! I can\u2019t listen to two of you at once!\u2019 The same\nissue arises in a presentation where there is a dissonance between what is\nbeing said and what is being read. Some of the audience will give priority to\nthe audio channel; others to the visual channel; others will switch\nuncertainly from one to the other. Speakers need to think carefully about how\nto distribute their content when using visual aids.\n\nUniversally acknowledged to be the worst practice is \u2018PowerPoint karaoke\u2019.\nThis is where a text is put up on a slide, and the speaker then painstakingly\nreads it out, word by word. Most people, of course, have already seen what is\non the slide as soon as it appears and have speed-read it, so that the spoken\nversion is redundant. If it contains humour, the joke has been appreciated\nbefore it is said, so that any punchline loses its impact and receives only\npolite laughter. And because visual processing is always a little ahead of\nauditory processing, there\u2019s a constant tension between reading and listening\nthat is counter-productive. Irritation levels often rise.\n\nVisual aids are a good servant of eloquence, but a bad master. At their best,\nthey provide a springboard that enables a speaker to convey a message in an\ninteresting, immediate, and memorable way. For those who have never seen a\npicture of Shakespeare\u2019s First Folio or an original King James Bible \u2013 and if\nthe speaker doesn\u2019t happen to have brought one along \u2013 the sheer size and\nweight of the objects can be appreciated through a picture. And there\u2019s no\nreal substitute for a well-designed graph or pie-chart showing trends, such as\na swing between political parties at an election, or a growth in sales of a\ncommercial product. Good supporting visual material can help foster eloquence.\n\nOn the other hand, visual aids can impose a straitjacket that leads to the\ndisaster I reported in [Chapter 4](part0012.html#ch4), where an overrunning\nspeaker had to rush through a series of slides in order to reach his\nconclusion. The unpredictability I mentioned above can arise from all sorts of\ncauses. Even if your speech has been carefully prepared and rehearsed, a new\nthought may strike you as you speak, and you find yourself running with it. Or\na prepared point may take longer to explore than you expected. Or an\nunexpected audience reaction or external event may take you off in a fresh\ndirection. Or you have to start late because of an overrunning introduction.\nWhatever the cause, the consequence is a loss of time. And it\u2019s surprising how\nquickly a series of small time losses can lead to the sudden realization that\nyou have only five minutes left and you have eight slides to go.\n\nThe point is a general one: even if you\u2019re using no visual aids, these factors\ncan make time run away with you. Indeed, unless you are a hugely self-\ndisciplined and well-rehearsed speaker, it\u2019s almost bound to happen. You will\nhave to talk-trim. So how is the problem of time management best handled?\n\nAt the end of [Chapter 9](part0022.html#ch9) I talked about the way an\naudience\u2019s attention span \u2013 typically around ten minutes \u2013 motivates a modular\nstructure for a long speech. It is in fact a very natural way of proceeding\nwhen you first sit down and think about what you\u2019re going to say. You jot down\na series of points as headings and then organize them into a logical sequence.\nYou think about what you want to say under each heading, and estimate how long\nit will take to deal with it. A module is simply this chunk of time-related\ncontent. Through rehearsal \u2013 or repetition, if the talk is being given several\ntimes \u2013 you sharpen your sense of the time involved in presenting each module.\n\nIf a talk is planned in this modular way, it provides a mechanism that can be\na lifeline for an overrunning speaker. Let\u2019s imagine a thirty-minute talk that\nhas been structured as a series of eight modules: a two-minute opening story,\nperhaps, followed by a five-minute introduction, a ten-minute major theme,\nfour follow-ups each taking three minutes, and a one-minute conclusion. That\u2019s\nthirty minutes, without any unexpected things happening.\n\nBut let\u2019s say that the major theme, or the first follow-up, or the attention-\nrecharging lulls between modules take up more time than expected. You realize,\ntwenty-five minutes in, that you have dealt with only two follow-ups. There\nare two to go. That\u2019s six minutes plus your conclusion. You have to talk-trim\nif you are to finish on time. The solution is obvious: omit one of the follow-\nups. A modular structure, whether in your head or summarized in note form,\nallows you to see the options easily. You won\u2019t feel particularly happy about\nit, but because each module is self-contained the audience will never know.\nAnd if the talk is followed by a Q&A, there may well be a chance to\nreintroduce the omitted content later.\n\nThis last point is actually more important than it might seem to be, because a\nspeaker\u2019s performance in a Q&A session can be a better index of eloquence than\nwhat has taken place in the preceding talk. Experienced speakers know how to\nmanage Q&A sessions. If they have given a talk on several occasions, they know\nthe kinds of questions that are likely to be asked, and have a repertoire of\nwell-tested responses. Because they know their subject well, they have a\nfurther resource of mini-modules relevant to what they have been saying. If a\nquestion relates directly to one of them, they are home and dry. If it\ndoesn\u2019t, the skill of the presenter is to make one of those mini-modules seem\nrelevant to the question (\u2018That\u2019s a very interesting question, and it reminds\nme of \u2026\u2019). For the eloquent speaker, there is no such thing as an unanswerable\nquestion (or statement \u2013 for not all interventions from the floor turn out to\nbe questions). Equally, the skill of the practised political interviewer is to\nget the interviewee _not_ to go off-topic in this way, but to \u2018answer the\nquestion\u2019.\n\nInexperienced speakers always have too much material. I repeat what I said at\nthe end of [Chapter 4](part0012.html#ch4): they need to work out what they\nwant to say, in the time they\u2019ve been allotted, then think how they would say\nit if they had only half the time. They need to be prepared to cut, and know\nin advance which points can be cut without serious loss. (If reading a text,\nthey should never need to cut, if they\u2019ve timed it exactly in advance,\nmonitoring reading-aloud rate, and allowing for pauses, possible audience\nreactions, and delays caused by overrunning introducers.) You may think that\nthe minute-totals above are unnecessarily precise. They aren\u2019t. Being aware of\nthe value of minutes and seconds in modules is part of the skill-set of an\neloquent speaker, and is something that is increasingly demanded in online\nsettings such as podcasts, which may be quite precisely time-delimited.\n\nAlso part of the skill-set is the ability to create a modular structure that\nsuits the needs of any public-speaking situation. There are aspects of\ndelivery that all public-speaking situations share, but there are also\nimportant differences of content and style. How many such situations are\nthere?\n\n\nINTERLUDE 21\n\n\nDebating the point\n\n![Crystal](../images/00026.jpeg)\n\nWith debates, time is of the essence. Speakers will be penalized or cut off if\nthey exceed their allotted limit. In parliamentary debate, the overall time\nallocated to a debate governs the amount of time individual speakers have. A\nguaranteed number of minutes is given to the mover of the debate, the official\nOpposition speakers, and the responding minister. Others who have made known\ntheir wish to speak have time equally allotted.\n\nIf it\u2019s a long debate of four to six hours, the mover is allowed twenty\nminutes, the Opposition speaker twelve, and the minister replying twenty-five.\nOther speakers have up to ten minutes each. If the debate is shorter, the\nspeakers\u2019 time is proportionately reduced. In a debate of two to three hours,\nthe allocations go down to fifteen, ten, and twenty respectively. In a short\ndebate of ninety minutes, it goes down further to twelve, eight and fifteen.\n\nHow do people keep to time? Digital clocks show the number of minutes that\nhave elapsed since the start of each speech. However, the Noble Lords it seems\nare not always diligent in this respect. In 2005, a Select Committee Report on\nthe Speakership of the House added a note:\n\nWe suggest that it would facilitate self-regulation and be helpful to the\nFront Benches, the Member speaking and the House generally if the digital\nclock in the Chamber \u2013 as in the Commons \u2013 began to flash a minute", "doc_id": "8eddeb0b-3d8f-436b-86b5-df5a8045336c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c865003402398f9af6eb3d7bdded1b4e047987c9f7aebcd7bc504965f93e5767", "extra_info": null, "index": 21, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 274612, "end": 288779}, "image": null}, "4814941544663813778": {"text": "is shorter, the\nspeakers\u2019 time is proportionately reduced.

Or, putting this another way, it suggests that you can talk about\nnothing at all, or say the greatest rubbish, and with good delivery people\nwill be impressed and walk away thinking they\u2019ve learned something. There\u2019s a\ncertain amount of truth in that. I remember once getting into a real tangle at\na university lecture. I was using notes, and they\u2019d got muddled, so the\nexposition was, to say the least, confused, and at the end I was furious with\nmyself. But then someone came up and said it was a really interesting talk and\nthanked me warmly. I had, it seems, expressed my poor thinking eloquently.\n\nContent is not really the subject of this book, but there are certain aspects\nof content that do directly affect our judgement about the eloquence of a\ndelivery. This is because the various situations in which we speak present us\nwith constraints that govern the way we select and organize what we have to\nsay. There\u2019s a branch of linguistics called stylistics that studies the way\ndifferent varieties of language contain predictable elements that have to be\nused if the varieties are to be recognized. If we hear such phrases as \u2018legal\nEnglish\u2019, \u2018religious English\u2019, \u2018sports commentary\u2019, and \u2018journalese\u2019, we can\nto a certain extent predict the kind of language the texts will contain. And\nthe same applies to the phrase \u2018public speaking\u2019.\n\nEach stylistic variety in turn contains several sub-varieties, which are\nlinguistically very different from each other. Legal language is found, for\nexample, in contracts, wills, conveyances, and exchanges in court. Sports\ncommentary has as many genres as there are sports to talk about. In each case\nthe speaker or writer has to be aware of the demands of the situation and use\nlanguage in a way that respects these needs. The right kind of content has to\nbe selected, organized, and presented appropriately, recognizing any\ntraditions of use and the formality of the occasion. Football commentary\nwouldn\u2019t suit snooker, and vice versa.\n\nPublic speaking is no different. It consists of a range of genres, all of\nwhich are governed by convention. Sometimes these conventions are so general\nthat they allow the speaker a great deal of flexibility in what is to be said\nand how it can be said. At other times they are so strict that if they\u2019re not\nfollowed the speech would be considered a failure. All, of course, require the\nspeaker to respect the general considerations I described earlier, such as\nknowing the audience, being audible, mastering technology, and keeping to\ntime.\n\nThe number of public-speaking genres is actually quite small \u2013 fewer than\ntwenty. Some \u2013 such as speeches at weddings \u2013 are well treated in the form of\nself-help guides, these days often online; but others receive little or no\nattention. I\u2019ve compiled my own list below, based on my experience of each,\nand taking into account the kind of recommendations that are made in the self-\nhelp literature. (It doesn\u2019t include variations due to cultural diversity,\nsuch as those described in [Chapter 7](part0018.html#ch7).) Introducing a\nspeaker\n\nMain features: short, informative, formal.\n\nMost introductions need only a minute; anyone who says \u2018Well, you\u2019ve come to\nhear X rather than me\u2019 has gone on for too long. Informative here means\nidentifying the speaker, the occasion, and the title of the talk, including\nonly what the audience needs to know. Avoid saying \u2018This is someone who needs\nno introduction\u2019 and then introducing them at length. It\u2019s important to get\nthe biographical facts right (including the correct pronunciation of the name,\nif it\u2019s at all unusual), which may involve asking the speaker in advance.\nDon\u2019t use the occasion as a soapbox for your own opinions. Use informality,\nincluding humour, cautiously, and only if speaker-related. Avoid asking the\nspeaker beforehand what the speech is going to be about, but check any\nallusion to the content of the talk with the speaker, to avoid stealing any\nthunder. It never ceases to amaze me how often my introducer, having taken the\ntrouble to read the book I\u2019m going to be talking about, tells the very story I\nwas planning to use to open the talk.\n\n\nThanking a speaker\n\nMain features: very short, reflective, formal.\n\nVery short means usually less than a minute. Reflective means referring to\nwhat the speaker said, to show you\u2019ve been listening and appreciative (it\u2019s\nbad form to make a correction, even if you know an error was made). No need to\ngive exaggerated praise: if the speech was good, it\u2019s unnecessary; if bad,\nit\u2019s insincere. It\u2019s impossible to prepare in advance, therefore, as\nspontaneity is important. Referring to any notes you made is acceptable, but\nnot reading from a prepared text. If you\u2019ve been invited to make a formal vote\nof thanks, but haven\u2019t been introduced, say who you are, and why you\u2019ve been\nasked, so that the speaker and audience know.\n\n\nOpening an event\n\nMain features: short, focused, formal.\n\nUp to five minutes, thanking for the invitation, saying why you agreed to do\nit (especially if there\u2019s some personal connection), and thanking the\norganizers (especially if they\u2019re volunteers). The content should be related\nto the occasion; this isn\u2019t an opportunity to talk at length about yourself,\nthough the occasional jocular self-reference is appreciated, especially if\nyou\u2019re a well-known personality. For f\u00eates, bazaars, and other fund-raising\noccasions, emphasize the reason for the event and draw attention to those who\nwill benefit. It\u2019s crucial to formally end by declaring the event open.\n\n\nPresenting an award\n\nMain features: short, informative, personal.\n\nShort, yes, but not too short, as the occasion needs proper recognition \u2013\nusually up to five minutes. The person\u2019s achievement (or achievements, if it\u2019s\nfor a lifetime of service) needs brief recapitulation, as does the origin and\ncharacter of the award (the donating body, the object being awarded). Check\nthe exact name of the award. Say why you\u2019ve been asked to make the award, and\nyour feelings about the moment. Formality is variable. With some occasions,\nsuch as a retirement gift, the occasion can take on the character of a family\ngathering.\n\n\nReceiving an award\n\nMain features: very short, sincere, formal.\n\nUsually up to half a minute. The moment is inevitably emotional, but speakers\nneed to bear in mind that any excess of emotion can cause embarrassment and\nprovoke later criticism (the Oscars syndrome). It\u2019s important to recognize the\ndonating organization and to thank anyone who helped you to the position.\nAcknowledge others who may have been in the running for the award. Avoid\nsaying \u2018I don\u2019t deserve this\u2019, even if you feel it; at best it sounds clich\u00e9d\nand at worst suggests a criticism of those who thought you did.\n\n\nMaking a toast\n\nMain features: short, focused, formal.\n\nIf it\u2019s a loyal or patriotic toast, the name of the person being toasted is\nall that is required, said proudly and loudly (\u2018The Queen!\u2019) \u2013 minimalist\neloquence. It\u2019s important to get the phrasing exactly right, though, if\nthere\u2019s an official name and traditional wording for a toast (\u2018Rotary\nInternational, and peace the world over\u2019). Give people time to repeat the\ntoast before you sit down. If it\u2019s a social toast, such as to a couple\ncelebrating an anniversary, length and formality are flexible, but two or\nthree minutes would be usual. An apposite quotation can be effective, as long\nas it isn\u2019t so well known as to be a clich\u00e9. Toasts always end with the names\nof the people to be toasted.\n\nSpeaking at a school speech day\n\nMain features: no more than twenty minutes, lively, anecdotal.\n\nMany people have memories of interminable school speech days, and wishing the\nevent was over. If it is your own old school, the obvious focus is on your\nrole in connecting past and present, with liveliness added by personal\nmemories and stories. If you are an outsider, there are parallels to be drawn\nwith other institutions. Check with the headteacher if there\u2019s anything you\u2019re\nexpected to say (such as asking for a school holiday). The audience is\nthreefold: school staff and governors, parents and relatives, students. If you\nfocus on the first two groups, only they will enjoy it. Focus on the last, and\neveryone will.\n\nGiving an after-dinner speech Main features: undemanding, self-related, witty.\n\nThe time varies greatly \u2013 usually no less than ten or fifteen minutes, but not\nmuch longer unless this has been agreed in advance (often the case with a\ncelebrity speaker). If the event is in the evening, and especially when\nfollowing other speakers, keeping the speech short is likely to be\nappreciated. The personality of the speaker is a critical element, so this is\nnot an occasion to be self-effacing. Formality varies with the occasion, but\neven the most formal of occasions enjoy humour. Use of visual aids can be\ndifficult, given awkward room-dimensions and round-table seating. Attention\ncan also vary outside normal limits, especially if coffee is still being\nserved while you talk and your listeners are being asked if they want it black\nor white. With a late-evening talk, even the most eloquent of speakers may be\nunable to stem approaching somnolence. Beware the effects of alcohol, which\ncan make your speech seem to you \u2013 but to nobody else \u2013 to be supremely\neloquent.\n\nGiving a family speech on a happy occasion\n\nMain features: informal, personal, emotional.\n\nThese are special occasions \u2013 such as a birthday, silver wedding anniversary,\nor engagement \u2013 where the enjoyment lies in the intimacy of the gathering. The\ncontent is formed chiefly out of memories and anecdotes, and speakers have to\nbe prepared for good-humoured boisterous audience interaction. There\u2019s no\nfixed time -frame, but most speakers don\u2019t go on for more than five minutes.\nThere may be visual aids, in the form of photographs, video recordings, and\nmemorabilia.\n\nGiving a family speech on a sad occasion\n\nMain features: formal, personal, emotional, focused.\n\nFunerals, memorials, and other sombre occasions have no fixed time frame,\nthough anything less than five minutes would probably be thought insufficient.\nThe mood requires elevated words, which can often be taken effectively from\nliterature, but private memories are also privileged. An element of nostalgic\nhumour can lighten an occasion, and if the event is perceived as a celebration\nof a life, then virtually anything can be said, as long as it is focused on\nthe individual.\n\n\nSpeaking at a wedding\n\nMain features: short, informal, personal, witty, traditional.\n\nWith a traditional wedding, the three-speech format suggests a comfortable\ntime frame of around five minutes per speaker. The father of the bride (or\nwhoever is giving the bride away) speaks first, and toasts the bride and\ngroom. The bridegroom replies on behalf of his wife, includes thanks to\nparents and organizers, and toasts the bridesmaids. The best man replies on\nbehalf of the bridesmaids, in a speech that can be longer because there is\nmore to do. In addition to any personal anecdotes (about the groom), there may\nbe messages to be read from people who cannot be present \u2013 in which case, he\nneeds to explain who they are (which may require some preliminary checking).\nVisual aids (such as embarrassing pictures of the groom) are appreciated, as\nlong as everyone can see them. The best man may also need to act as master of\nceremonies if there\u2019s no toastmaster there to do it. These days, the speech\nroles can be distributed more widely: to have two best men allows an\nopportunity for a \u2018double-act\u2019 speech, and the bride or a bridesmaid may take\non a main speaking role. An important task is to ensure that everyone\u2019s glass\nis filled before a toast. This invariably improves the audience\u2019s perception\nof eloquence.\n\nSpeaking to a club or society Main features: personal, focused, witty,\ninteractive.\n\nThe time frame needs to be agreed in advance, but \u2013 if there\u2019s no preceding\nmeal \u2013 is usually between thirty and forty-five minutes. Most such occasions\nexpect an opportunity for questions. It is important to check if the time\nallotted includes this session or not, and also who will be in charge of it \u2013\nthe speaker or someone else. In particular, it needs to be agreed who is\nresponsible for informing everyone of the critical moment that brings the\nevent to a close: the \u2018last question\u2019. (And then tactfully ending the meeting,\nif that last question turns out to be an interminable statement.) Giving a\nlecture or conference presentation\n\nMain features: fixed time, informative, formal, often technological.\n\nEarlier chapters have addressed several of the issues that arise when people\nspeak to industry conferences, make presentations at business meetings, or\ngive academic lectures. The time frame is a given, but it needs to be checked\nwhether there is to be a Q&A session, along with the other factors described\nin [Chapter 4](part0012.html#ch4). The content will be affected by the talk\nstatus (whether the conference has a theme and whether", "doc_id": "3084c8f8-e70a-413e-b7a8-f575fb5bf796", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "be2c188a6758e6478e37ec6d64597ac4cdd571da997cf7992c88ddd0fb5ea463", "extra_info": null, "index": 22, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 288733, "end": 302611}, "image": null}, "7953282881223228317": {"text": "it needs to be agreed who is\nresponsible for informing everyone of the critical moment that brings the\nevent to a close: the \u2018last question\u2019.

Giving a\nlecture or conference presentation\n\nMain features: fixed time, informative, formal, often technological.\n\nEarlier chapters have addressed several of the issues that arise when people\nspeak to industry conferences, make presentations at business meetings, or\ngive academic lectures. The time frame is a given, but it needs to be checked\nwhether there is to be a Q&A session, along with the other factors described\nin [Chapter 4](part0012.html#ch4). The content will be affected by the talk\nstatus (whether the conference has a theme and whether the talk is billed as a\n\u2018keynote\u2019) and where in the conference schedule it appears \u2013 beginning,\nmiddle, or end \u2013 as this will influence the extent to which it is possible to\nrefer to other contributions or conference activities.\n\n\nMaking a political speech\n\nMain features: short, identifying, rhetorical, formal.\n\nPolitical speeches have greatly varying time frames, depending on the\noccasion, though most are between fifteen and thirty minutes. There may be\nfixed time limits in particular settings established by tradition or\ncircumstance, such as speeches at an annual party meeting or within a\ngovernmental assembly. In these cases, the individuality of speakers is\nsecondary to the identity of their party or the cause they are supporting.\nSimilar issues arise with memorial speeches that address significant\nhistorical moments, such as a battle or a peace.\n\n\nContributing to a debate\n\nMain features: fixed time, interactive, rhetorical, semi-formal.\n\nWhether you are proposing a motion, opposing it, seconding it, or contributing\nfrom the floor, there will be a time limit to be respected. The structure of\nthe occasion is formal but speech style is commonly informal, bringing\nspeakers closer to the audience. The aim is to make the best possible case to\npersuade, so all three methods of rhetoric described in Interlude 7 (logos,\nethos, pathos) are used. The factual content of the argument is often enhanced\nby enthusiasm and humour. Debating manuals recommend that the focus of the\nspeech should be on the opponent\u2019s arguments, not on the opponent as a person,\nand that the manner of delivery should be polite and self-controlled; but\npress reports of \u2018ill-tempered debates\u2019 show that speakers don\u2019t always\nrespect the ideal of dispassionate deliberation.\n\n\nDistance broadcasting\n\nMain features: short, isolated, reactive, formal.\n\nSpeaking \u2018down the line\u2019 to a broadcasting station, from a home studio or by\ntelephone, live or pre-recorded, differs fundamentally from all other public-\nspeaking genres in that you inevitably feel communicatively isolated. You have\nno eye-contact with the interviewer, and no simultaneous visual feedback about\nhow you\u2019re doing. Nor should you expect to receive vocal reactions (of the\n\u2018mhm\u2019 type), as radio interviewers know these sound intrusive. The situation\nis exacerbated if you\u2019re contributing to a panel where you can see none of the\nother participants. The interviewer is in control, so you have no choice other\nthan to be reactive, as in a Q&A session \u2013 though, as there, you can turn the\nquestions in any direction you want. At least you don\u2019t have to worry about\nhow you look, and the pressure can be reduced by having notes available as an\naide-memoire. Experienced radio presenters suggest speakers should forget the\npotentially vast and mixed nature of the listening audience, and imagine they\nare talking to just one person. Most interviews are short, around three or\nfour minutes, so points need to be made as succinctly as possible.\n\n\nPodcasting and vodcasting\n\nMain features: variable time, isolated, proactive, variable formality.\n\nPodcasts can be as varied as any traditional broadcasting programmes. Most\ninformally produced podcasts are between five and fifteen minutes long, but\nambitious ones can be an hour or more. They can be audio alone or with video\n(vodcasting). As the recording isn\u2019t live you have the option of redoing it or\nediting it. Retakes may reduce spontaneity, but they invariably improve\nfluency. As with any broadcast, you have only a vague idea of who will\neventually be listening or watching, so your choice of content has to be\nproactive, full of conviction, and self-contained. With video productions it\u2019s\nimportant to check that there\u2019s nothing distracting (or embarrassing) in shot\nbehind you, and how much of your body can be seen by the viewer (hand and arm\nmovements are especially likely to be constrained). Keeping yourself in shot\ncan affect your ability to speak naturally, especially if you\u2019re used to\nspeaking with a lot of body movement. I usually end up feeling very stiff.\n\n\nMaking a live video presentation\n\nMain features: variable time, proactive, pseudo-interactive, formal.\n\nIn addition to the factors just mentioned in relation to vodcasts, live video\ncommunication adds the element of technological uncertainty. Whenever I give a\ntalk via a medium such as Skype, I always warn my audience at the outset that\nthe connection might break, and that they should be patient if it does. When\nit is restored, you need to check the point at which your speech was lost, and\nbe prepared to continue from that place. If the link is one where you can see\nthe faces of some of the audience at the receiving venue, bear in mind that\nthe reactions of those you can see may not be shared by others in the room.\nThere\u2019s also likely to be an electronic lag, so that reactions to what you\u2019re\nsaying reach you after a short delay. In a face-to-face talk, you can tell how\nlong to pause after a joke before continuing with your speech as the feedback\nis simultaneous. With distance speaking, this feedback is missing, so you just\nhave to guess whether your joke has been successful or not. The same point\napplies in a video conference: if you pause for too long after making a point,\nother participants will think you have finished, and they will chip in. Live\nvideo links provide a spurious impression of interactive reality.\n\n\nMaking an impromptu speech\n\nMain features: short, informal, personal, reactive.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t happen very often, but if you attend occasions where you might be\n\u2018asked to say a few words\u2019, it\u2019s as well to be prepared, to avoid what would\notherwise be uncomfortable and uncomforting waffle. Nobody will expect a\ncrafted speech, but an anecdote, as part of your personal reaction to the\nevent, is always appreciated. A small mental stock of stories is a useful\nresource \u2013 as long as they are recycled at intervals. An allusion to something\nfrom a recent daily newspaper or TV show helps ensure freshness.\n\nIn all of these genres, apart from the last, there\u2019s a choice to be made: is\nthe speech to be spoken or written? The most effective deliveries, in terms of\nthe scale of eloquence I outlined in [Chapter 1](part0006.html#ch1), are those\nwhere speakers make no use of written material. But reading a written text\naloud can still be supremely effective, as my Obama analysis illustrated, as\nlong as it is properly managed. For speakers who don\u2019t have the services of a\nteleprompter or autocue \u2013 which means most of us \u2013 our text will be on paper,\noften on more than one page, held in the hand or on a lectern. These simple\nfactors present the greatest challenges to eloquence, and require proper stage\nmanagement to be overcome.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 22\n\nAutocues for all?\n\n![Crystal](../images/00027.jpeg)\n\nWhen I wrote that most of us don\u2019t have the services of a teleprompter, I\nshould have said \u2018not yet\u2019. Smartglasses already exist that can project text\ninto your field of vision, and it\u2019s presumably only going to be a matter of\ntime before unobtrusive forms of these devices are routinely worn by speakers\nto make their notes privately visible, or to scroll down their text at a\ncontrollable rate.\n\n\n23\n\n\nReading it\n\nWhen reading a text aloud in public, the immediate challenge is how to foster\nan interaction with the audience. At several points in this book I\u2019ve drawn\nattention to the importance of maintaining apparent eye -contact with\neveryone. Turning your back on an audience is a definite disaster. So is\nkeeping your head down while reading. Some of the worst reactions come when\nall listeners have seen is the top of a bowed head. \u2018I might as well have\nwaited until I read it in the proceedings,\u2019 grumbled one conference attendee.\n\u2018At least I could skim the boring bits then.\u2019\n\nTo leave the page and look around the audience is a risk. For a start, you\nhave to be sure you can find your way back to where you were. Speakers develop\ntheir own techniques for doing this. A common one \u2013 if both hands are resting\nlightly on the lectern \u2013 is to use a finger to point to the location. But more\nimportant is to lay out the text in such a way that you can easily see where\nyou are up to.\n\nLayout is important for a second reason: it allows you to superimpose on your\ntext the features of delivery that are pre-requisite for eloquence. Chief\namong these is the memory processing limitation that I explored in [Chapter\n10](part0024_split_000.html#ch10). Complex speech is most comfortably\nprocessed in intonation-plus-rhythm chunks containing around five information\nunits. Speaking aloud, likewise, is most comfortably presented in chunks of a\nsimilar length, as Interlude 10 indicated (p. 83). So when writing a text for\nspoken delivery, it\u2019s wise to be aware of this constraint. But, as pointed out\nin [Chapter 10](part0024_split_000.html#ch10), it\u2019s a totally different task\nfrom writing a text that will only be read, for readers have the option of\nrereading. In a live presentation, there\u2019s no such thing as relistening.\n\nActually, I always like to read my writing aloud before publishing something \u2013\neven in a book which is never going to be heard in spoken form. If there\u2019s too\nmuch information in a chunk of spoken text, this quickly becomes apparent\nbecause the rhythm falters and breath control deteriorates. A simple way of\nensuring that this doesn\u2019t happen is to mark up the text into rhythm units or\nto lay it out in such a way that the rhythm units can be clearly seen. And if\none of these units remains excessively long, rephrase. Here\u2019s an example from\nthe paragraph you\u2019ve just read.\n\nFirst, the intonation-plus-rhythm units are shown by slashes: Actually, / I\nalways like to read my writing aloud before publishing something / \u2013 even in a\nbook which is never going to be heard in spoken form. / If there\u2019s too much\ninformation in a chunk of spoken text, / this quickly becomes apparent /\nbecause the rhythm falters and breath control deteriorates. / A simple way of\nensuring that this doesn\u2019t happen / is to mark up the text into rhythm units /\nor to lay it out in such a way that the rhythm units can be clearly seen. /\nAnd if one of these units remains excessively long, / rephrase. / Here\u2019s an\nexample from the paragraph you\u2019ve just read.\n\nNote that punctuation isn\u2019t always a reliable guide to rhythm units. There\u2019s\nno punctuation after _apparent_ , for example. Some writers would insert a\ncomma there, for that reason, but this option isn\u2019t available after _happen_ ,\nbecause one of the rules of modern English punctuation states that a comma\nshould never separate a subject and a verb.\n\nI know speakers who always mark up their texts in this way. Or parts of their\ntexts. I do, whenever a sentence gets at all complex. Churchill did. The\nconventions vary a lot. I use slashes and continuation marks. Others might\nprefer highlighters, in various colours, or underlinings. And some use layout.\nHere\u2019s that paragraph with layout identifying the rhythm units:\n\nActually, I always like to read my writing aloud before publishing something \u2013\neven in a book which is never going to be heard in spoken form.\n\nIf there\u2019s too much information in a chunk of spoken text, this quickly\nbecomes apparent\n\nbecause the rhythm falters and breath-control deteriorates.\n\nA simple way of ensuring that this doesn\u2019t happen\n\nis to mark up the text into rhythm units\n\nor to lay it out in such a way that the rhythm units can be clearly seen.\n\nAnd if one of these units remains excessively long, rephrase.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from the paragraph you\u2019ve just read.\n\nIt\u2019s now beginning to look like a poem, but I see that as a plus.\n\nNote that the grammar of the language makes some rhythm-unit divisions more\nimportant than others. An opening adverb ( _Actually_ ) or a short parenthesis\nof closure ( _rephrase_ ) can be tacked onto another unit without loss. This\nis because their meaning is totally dependent on what follows or precedes.\nIndeed, to give them separate lines may actually foster a reverse effect: the\nspeech can become vocally bitty. To avoid this happening, a third option is to\ncombine the above two approaches, marking different lengths of pause (/, //,\n///) and continuations (shown by ^). Here\u2019s one way of reading this paragraph:\n\nActually, I always like to read my writing aloud before publishing something^\n\u2013 even in a book which is never going to be heard in spoken form. //\n\nIf there\u2019s too much information in a chunk of spoken text, ^\n\nthis quickly becomes apparent /\n\nbecause the rhythm falters and breath-control deteriorates. //\n\nA simple way of ensuring that this doesn\u2019t happen^\n\nis to mark up the text into rhythm units /\n\nor to lay it out in such a way that the rhythm units can be clearly seen. //\n\nAnd if one of these units remains excessively long, rephrase. ///\n\nHere\u2019s an example from the paragraph you\u2019ve just read. ///\n\nNow the text is moving in the direction of a musical score.

And in 1775,\nJoshua Steele included musical staves for his spoken examples in his\nsuggestively titled _An Essay Towards Establishing the Melody and Measure of\nSpeech to be Expressed and Perpetuated by Certain Symbols_.\n\nI said above \u2018one way of reading\u2019. It would be perfectly possible to read that\nparagraph aloud in a slightly different way. And in a highly rhetorical\nparagraph, such as one of Obama\u2019s, there would be many noticeable differences\nin the way it could be read. The techniques are helpful to discourse analysts,\ntherefore, as they highlight contrasts in speaker style. But they aid the\nreader too, for positive and negative reasons. Not only do they provide cues\nto promote an eloquent reading, they help the reader to avoid miscues.\n\nA miscue occurs when the way a text is laid out makes you read something the\nwrong way. You realize what\u2019s happened, and so you reread. Even newsreaders\nhave slipped up in this respect: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll read that again.\u2019 A bad\nline-break is a common cause. A sentence appears to finish at the end of a\nline when in fact it carries on: This sentence appears to finish at the end of\nthe line when actually it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe risk is that you will use a falling tone on _line_ , suggesting finality,\neven though there\u2019s no full stop there. (Full stops are the least visible of\npunctuation marks.) You\u2019re then left with a _when_ clause hanging in the air.\nTo avoid this, you can add a continuation mark after _line_.\n\nAnother very common miscue is caused by the conjunctions _and_ and _or_. How\nis this sentence to continue?\n\nWe can show the rhythm units using slashes or \u2026\n\nI might go on to say this:\n\nWe can show the rhythm units using slashes or brackets.\n\nOr it might be this:\n\nWe can show the rhythm units using slashes or we can use an array of specially\ndevised punctuation marks.\n\nIf the _or_ appears at the end of a line, there can be a moment of\nuncertainty. Is the next bit going to be a phrase (in which case there should\nbe no pause after _slashes_ ) or a clause (in which case there should be, as\nthe clause is quite a long one)?\n\nMiscues are usually avoidable by a preliminary reading aloud of a text. It has\nto be aloud: silent reading won\u2019t bring them to light. Rehearsal also reveals\nother problems of layout, such as a page turnover interfering with a critical\nsemantic point or pages inadvertently being out of order (ensure each page is\nnumbered). Even the most accomplished of speakers can get into trouble if\ntheir fingers slip while page-turning or if pages get stuck together. If this\nhappens at a point of paragraph division, the problem is trivial. If it occurs\nin the middle of a rhetorical build-up, it can ruin the effect. And opening a\nnew paragraph on the last line of a page is never a good idea.\n\nRehearsed reading is critical. Nobody should ever read a text aloud in public\nwithout having first heard it themselves. Apart from anything else, the\nexercise gives speakers a sense of their limitations. How much visual text can\nyou take in at a time and retain in your working memory while you speak it\nout? Some people can take in two or three lines of text without difficulty,\nespecially if it\u2019s laid out well. Others have trouble retaining more than one.\nFamiliarity with the text to be read can increase the amount of retention,\nimprove speech flow, and avoid the distracting effect of rapid head-bobbing.\n\nRehearsal also allows the speaker to develop a sense of the text as a whole.\nAny effective speech is a coherent discourse. There is an arc of eloquence,\nand the various elements of the speech take their place within it. With short\nspeeches, the arc is readily perceived. It will involve all the features I\u2019ve\nmentioned earlier in this book, such as lulls, contrasts, build-ups, and\npoints of climax, which are no less important just because a speech is written\ndown.\n\nThe basic unit of discourse in a written text is the paragraph, not the\nsentence, and its identity must be respected when reading aloud. From an\nauditory point of view, perceiving a paragraph involves two features: an\nidentifiable opening and an identifiable closure. The opening is always\nsignalled by a rise in pitch, and the closure by a longer pause than those\nused to separate sentences. Radio newsreaders are adept at this. Listen to a\nnews broadcast and note the way each new item of news is signalled by the\nopening words rising to a pitch level above the speaker\u2019s norm, after a\nlonger-than-usual pause. The prosodic structure of a typical news broadcast\nlooks like this: An effective speech should display a similar structure.\n\n![Crystal](../images/00028.jpeg)\n\nIf a rise in pitch signals a paragraph opening, it\u2019s important not to\nintroduce a similar pitch-rise within a paragraph, as this is likely to give\nlisteners an auditory miscue. There needs to be a gradual decline in pitch\nover a paragraph, so that the last sentence is at the lowest level, running\nnaturally into the paragraph-ending pause. For this to be most effective,\nparagraphs should not be too short or too long. There\u2019s no fixed rule, as\nlength will be dependent on the nature of the content. But if a paragraph\ncontains just one or two sentences, it won\u2019t give enough scope for the speaker\nto construct an effective auditory arc. Equally, it\u2019s difficult to maintain an\nauditory arc if a paragraph goes on for longer than five or six sentences \u2013\nfewer, if the sentences are internally complex.\n\nLarger than the paragraph are the major organizational divisions of the text \u2013\nthematic sections and sub-sections. These need to be perceived too. The points\nof division are most obviously signalled by a longer pause than occurs between\nparagraphs. Many speakers reinforce their arrival by something external, such\nas a drink of water, a shuffling of papers, a new slide, or a fresh body\nposture. The text itself will provide clues too, of course (\u2018Now let\u2019s move on\nto \u2026\u2019). But textual clues need to be supported by prosodic, paralinguistic,\nand extralinguistic effects if they are to be perceived most effectively. The\nbest eloquence makes maximum use of all available communicative resources.\n\nFinally, when rehearsing, it\u2019s good practice to vary your starting point, and\nnot restrict yourself to \u2018beginning at the beginning\u2019. If your speech has six\nmodules, spend some time treating each as if it were a self-contained speech.\nThe memory of doing this can inject an element of freshness at a point in a\nlive presentation when your momentum might have declined. And it makes you\nbetter prepared for the unexpected distraction that might otherwise put you\noff your stroke.\n\nIt\u2019s something virtuoso musicians do, anxious to minimize the risk of losing\ntheir place in a memorized solo performance. If they\u2019re used only to\nperforming the piece from the very beginning, it can be difficult to deal with\na sudden distraction (such as a mobile phone going off) that interrupts their\ninternalized sequence of notes. Less experienced players may have to go back\nto the beginning in order to continue. Practising a piece by starting in\nvarious places, it seems, reduces a player\u2019s anxiety and makes them more able\nto cope with the unexpected. When I put this to Welsh pianist virtuoso Iwan\nLlewelyn-Jones, he commented that, for him, this technique was \u2018a key factor \u2013\nnot only aiding memory, but strengthening the interpretation from several\nmusical perspectives: structural cohesion, breathing and punctuation, focusing\nthe arguments with dynamic shading and pacing\u2019. In his choice of phrases, he\ncould have been talking about eloquence.\n\n\u2018Reducing anxiety\u2019. Nerves, in short.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 23\n\n\nLaying it out\n\n![Crystal](../images/00029.jpeg)\n\nTwo examples of effective speech layouts. Both are from Winston Churchill. The\nspeech \u2018paragraphs\u2019 stand out well, and the stepped indention provides the\nspeaker with a clear indication of how the indication of the prosodic\nstructure (p. 199) should be distributed. The short lines identify the rhythm\nunits and the places to pause.\n\n\n24\n\n\nNerve ending\n\nMark Twain, in an often-quoted remark, once asserted: \u2018There are two types of\nspeakers: those that get nervous and those that are liars.\u2019 The exact words\nvary a little, depending on which source you use, but the sentiment is clear.\nNerves are inevitable and natural, when speaking in public. There are no\nexceptions. So for those who say they suffer from them, the obvious question\nis how to deal with them, and that first means understanding what they are.\n\n_Nerve_ : the word arrived in English in the late fourteenth century, from\nLatin _nervus_ , carrying over the physical meaning of \u2018sinew, tendon\u2019 and\nthus \u2018strength, energy\u2019. _Nervous_ too had a physical meaning at first:\n\u2018relating to sinews or tendons\u2019. You could describe a bow strung with a sinew\nas being nervous; and if you had arms with prominent sinews, they could also\nbe described as nervous. It\u2019s a point to watch when reading old texts: a\n\u2018nervous horse\u2019, in the 1600s, meant a strong, muscular one. It was only in\nthe eighteenth century that the word came to mean \u2018anxious, apprehensive\u2019.\n\nToday, the word is used to describe a wide range of feelings, from the mildest\nof butterflies to a total paralysis, where the speaker is apparently unable to\nmove, let alone speak. I have seen someone in this state, who had to be gently\nled from the stage after a minute or so of awful, immobile silence, followed\nby an announcement from the organizer apologizing for the speaker not being\nwell. There is indeed an identified phobia \u2013 glossophobia \u2013 which is a\nprofound fear of public speaking. As with any genuine phobia, it needs special\nhelp. That\u2019s not what most people mean when they say they\u2019re nervous about\ngetting up to speak.\n\n\u2018Routine\u2019 nerves, if I may call them that, have milder but very noticeable\nsymptoms, such as a dry mouth, a faster and erratic pattern of breathing, a\nsense of the stomach fluttering or churning, unexpected perspiration, shaky\nlimbs. Some people feel nauseous; some find an urgent need to go to the\ntoilet. Charlie Brown went further:\n\n![Crystal](../images/00030.jpeg)\n\nNerves generally recede with experience \u2013 though I do know eloquent speakers\nwho admit to being initially nervous every time they stand up. However, they\nusually then go on to talk about the importance of adrenaline, and affirm that\nthe nervousness actually spurs them on. The important thing, they say, is to\nchannel the energy released by the adrenaline into the performance. Several\nactors have told me that, without that adrenaline rush, they feel their\nperformance was more lacklustre. But what does \u2018channelling energy\u2019 mean? And\nhow do we actually do it?\n\n_Adrenaline_ is a word that\u2019s been used to mean \u2018nervous energy\u2019 since the\n1920s. The way it works in the body is now well known. When we encounter a\npotentially stressful situation, the brain sends a message to our adrenal\nglands (located on top of the kidneys) to release various hormones into our\nbloodstream, adrenaline being the primary one. It\u2019s an evolutionary adaptation\nthat allows us to react to danger without life-threatening delay. The effect\non us is often called the \u2018fight or flight\u2019 reaction; we have the option of\nfighting the danger or fleeing from it.\n\nWe need extra energy whether we fight or flee. The effect of the adrenaline is\nto make the blood vessels contract in most parts of the body, so that more\nblood is directed towards the heart, lungs, and muscles. Heart rate and blood\npressure rise, sending improved circulation to the limb muscles that will\nenable us to act quickly. The air passages dilate and breathing rate goes up,\nallowing more oxygen into the lungs quickly, and giving us bursts of improved\nperformance. As a result, less blood is available for parts of the body less\ndirectly involved in fight/flight, such as the stomach.\n\nThe importance of the link between the nervous systems of the brain and the\nstomach, long recognized in Eastern medicine, is now very much appreciated in\nWestern medical research, where the term _gut\u2013brain axis_ is frequently\nencountered. English vocabulary has also long suggested the connection,\nthrough such idioms as _gut feeling_ and _gut reaction_. Adrenaline-induced\nvariations in the tension of the muscles comprising the sensitive, smooth wall\nof the stomach produce the fluttery sensations we describe as butterflies. An\nadrenaline rush can also impede digestion, which can in turn produce feelings\nof nausea.\n\nA comment often made by public speakers is that their nervousness disappears\nwhen they actually start talking. They say they are \u2018channelling the\nnervousness\u2019. This is because the energy being built up in the body (for fight\nor flight) finally has a chance to be released. Adrenaline causes the body to\nrelease glucose, which raises blood sugar levels, the primary source of\nenergy. If the energy has no outlet \u2013 because there\u2019s no real need to fight or\nflee just before a talk \u2013 it makes us restless and alters mood. Many speakers\nreport feeling unusually irritable in the period leading up to their talk, or\nless sociable, not wanting to talk to anyone, and wishing the well-meaning\nchatty chairperson would shut up.\n\nAll this immediately suggests one trick that I know many public speakers use.\nGet rid of the energy.", "doc_id": "3c6f8c76-1cdd-47dd-aa20-ec492a7f5bbf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9a7a4caa83482755e99ec680eca3efa455ab67dec9ea0e285b64fe834392548c", "extra_info": null, "index": 24, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 316782, "end": 330648}, "image": null}, "122534038792105186": {"text": "they actually start talking.

I\u2019ve seen some engage in brisk physical activity \u2013\npress-ups or arm swings \u2013 in the wings for a minute or so before being called\non to a stage. Actors spend a great deal of time \u2018warming up\u2019 physically,\nloosening their muscles (including their vocal cords). Going to the toilet\nhelps for that reason \u2013 not necessarily because there is actually any matter\nto excrete \u2013 but the getting there and back uses up some of that energy.\nEngaging in physical jerks isn\u2019t so easy during a dinner, sitting on a panel,\nor standing in a pulpit \u2013 though I don\u2019t deny that the effect of a vicar doing\npress-ups before a sermon could have a positive effect on a placid\ncongregation \u2013 but there are alternatives. _Peanuts_ again:\n\n![Crystal](../images/00031.jpeg)\n\nDeep breathing is the easiest alternative. This uses up a huge amount of\nenergy, almost without the person realizing it. A slow and steady intake of\nbreath, followed by a slow and steady release. There\u2019s no magic figure for\n\u2018slow and steady\u2019, as the time it takes us to breathe in and out varies\naccording to our age and physical condition, but most people are comfortable\nwith five or six seconds in, hold for a moment, and the same or a little\nlonger out. Some speakers follow a specific formula, such as Andrew Weil\u2019s\nfour in, seven hold, and eight out.[23](part0057.html#en23) Even just one such\niteration, immediately before speaking, can turn a quavery voice into a\nconfident one.\n\nDeep breathing is just one of various relaxation techniques that nervous\npublic speakers can use \u2013 and there\u2019s no shortage of books and online courses\nthat offer guidance, from short-term measures to long-term advice about\nlifestyle. From a linguistic point of view there are some obvious preparations\nthat can be made to anticipate symptoms. Dry mouth? Have a glass of water\navailable. Sweating? Keep a handkerchief handy. Stomach gurgling? Eat a banana\n(a well-tried acting remedy). Stomach churning? Where possible, avoid making\nthe stomach unnecessarily active through eating and drinking a lot immediately\nbefore the talk \u2013 though with wedding receptions and after-dinner speaking the\nsituation is out of the speaker\u2019s control. Avoid alcohol, unless you are\n_very_ sure of the way your body responds to it.\n\nAbove all, speakers need to reflect on the realities of their situation. It is\nnot actually fight or flight. You are in no physical danger. Your audience\nwants you to succeed. They are on your side. They are probably thanking their\nlucky stars right now that it is you, not they, who are about to talk. They\nknow they would be just as nervous, if not more so. In fact some may even be\nvicariously nervous, especially if they know you \u2013 being nervous on your\nbehalf, as it were. When a speaker makes an audience laugh at the very\nbeginning of a talk ([Chapter 8](part0020.html#ch8)), there is a collective\nrelaxation.\n\nThat\u2019s why it is so important never to look nervous when standing up to speak.\nIt is for your audience\u2019s benefit, not yours. That\u2019s why you should never draw\nattention to your nervousness at the beginning of a talk. The audience\naccommodates to it, and begins to feel nervous too. And \u2013 perhaps the most\nimportant piece of advice of all \u2013 if something goes wrong (a slip of the\ntongue, a misreading, a mispronunciation, a page out of order \u2026), that\u2019s why\nyou should Never Apologize, or even mention the mistake. That simply draws\nattention to the error, which most listeners will not have noticed anyway. As\njazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis put it: \u2018The nerves are a problem on trumpet,\nbecause when you mess up everyone can hear it. Just remember most people are\ntoo polite to say anything about it. That should calm your nerves.\u2019 For \u2018on\ntrumpet\u2019 read \u2018in public speaking\u2019.\n\nNerves, in brief, can help, not hinder eloquence, and certainly should never\nbe used as an excuse to get out of an opportunity to speak. There\u2019s no way I\nknow to eliminate them completely \u2013 certainly no linguistic way \u2013 but they can\nbe reduced by a build-up of the powerful antidote: confidence. And confidence\ncomes from being in control of what you\u2019re going to say and how you\u2019re going\nto say it \u2013 the theme of several earlier chapters. In short: preparation and\nrehearsal.\n\nIf you speak regularly, take a tip from the acting profession: reflect on the\nway past speaking situations weren\u2019t as bad as you expected. Remember the\nsense of achievement that followed the applause, and hold on to that. Some\nactors have told me they can reduce their nerves by recalling the buzz that\ncomes from repeated successful performances. This can help turn nervousness\ninto that closely related state of mind: excitement.\n\nThere are other tricks. Here\u2019s one from Richard Branson, in a talk he gave in\n2015:\n\nWhen you need to speak in front of a crowd, close your mind to the fact that\nyou\u2019re on a stage with hundreds of people watching you and instead imagine\nyourself in a situation where you\u2019d be comfortable speaking to a group. For\nexample, imagine that you\u2019re in your dining room at home, telling a story to\nfriends over dinner. I know it sounds a little corny, but try it. This trick\nhas certainly removed some of the anxiety for me.\n\nIt\u2019s not corny. Broadcasters train themselves to think this way. They don\u2019t\nthink of themselves as talking to millions. They imagine themselves talking to\nYou.\n\nKnowing that there are no exceptions can be a help \u2013 realizing we\u2019re no\ndifferent from everyone else. Twain\u2019s joke, with which I opened this chapter,\nis actually a tiny exaggeration: some people are so in command of their\nsubject and their audience that they don\u2019t get nervous as a rule, but even\nthey admit to a degree of nervousness when asked to do something well outside\ntheir routine. The more experienced a public speaker we are, the less we\u2019re\nlikely to be bothered by nerves, but they are always there, lurking in the\nwings, ready to jump out when an occasion forces us out of our comfort zone.\n\nAn annoying correlation is between great experience and great age. There comes\na point (so I\u2019m told) when we are less able to remember our lines, speak for\nlong periods without hoarseness, and come up with the general energy that\neloquence demands. Staying in the speaking business can thus become an\nincreasing source of nervousness. Something like this is presumably behind the\nsurprising admissions from well-known personalities we\u2019d expect to be so used\nto speaking in public that they would have lost their nerves years ago. Dame\nJudi Dench is on record as saying \u2018I have worse nerves now, fifty-four years\nafter entering this business, than when I started.\u2019[24](part0057.html#en24)\n\nI know of only one exception to the statement that public speaking is not\n\u2018actual flight\u2019. This happened at the Royal Institution in London, where there\nis a long-standing tradition of Friday evening discourses. It seems that when\nthese discourses first began, in the early nineteenth century, a lecturer who\nhad been invited to speak took fright when he entered the theatre and saw the\nelite scientists of London on all sides of him. He turned and fled. Since\nthen, visiting lecturers have been closely guarded to avoid the same thing\nhappening again.\n\nIn 1992 I gave such a discourse, and joined my hosts for dinner beforehand.\nWith five minutes to go, I found a burly sergeant-at-arms behind me. He took\nme by the shoulder and led me into a side room near the famous steeply tiered\nlecture theatre. He then withdrew and locked me in. Four -and -a -half minutes\nof deep breathing later, the door was unlocked, I was taken by the shoulder\nagain and led to the closed double doors into the lecture theatre. As the\nclock struck its first stroke, he opened the doors and I was thrust into the\nroom to begin my talk. Nerves become irrelevant when there\u2019s no escape.\n\n\nINTERLUDE 24\n\n\nPutting nerves to work\n\n![Crystal](../images/00032.jpeg)\n\nThere are occasions when acknowledging your nerves, if you\u2019re unused to public\nspeaking, can also help get an audience onto your side. Emma Watson went one\nfurther. The Harry Potter actress (Hermione) became the UN Women Goodwill\nAmbassador in July 2014, and later that year made an impressive speech at the\nUN headquarters in New York launching the HeForShe initiative for gender\nequality. Towards the end of her speech she mentioned her nerves, but used the\nmoment to introduce a slogan:\n\nIn my nervousness for this speech and in my moments of doubt I\u2019ve told myself\nfirmly \u2013 if not me, who? If not now, when? If you have similar doubts when\nopportunities are presented to you I hope those words might be helpful.\nBecause the reality is that if we do nothing it will take 75 years, or for me\nto be nearly a hundred before women can expect to be paid the same as men for\nthe same work. 15.5 million girls will be married in the next 16 years as\nchildren. And at current rates it won\u2019t be until 2086 before all rural African\ngirls will be able to receive a secondary education.\n\nThe slogan might not have been perceived as such, when first heard. But it\ntook on a powerful resonance when she used it again to end her speech. It was\na \u2018Yes we can\u2019 moment.\n\nWe are struggling for a uniting word but the good news is we have a uniting\nmovement. It is called HeForShe. I am inviting you to step forward, to be seen\nto speak up, to be the \u2018he\u2019 for \u2018she\u2019. And to ask yourself if not me, who? If\nnot now, when?\n\n\n25\n\n\nHomo eloquens\n\nSo, is the gab a gift? I might ask the question of any artistic form. Is\npainting a gift? Is singing? Is cooking? Clearly, some people are virtuoso\nspeakers, painters, singers, and cooks. They must, presumably, have some sort\nof special gift. But that doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us are giftless. On the\ncontrary: humans are wired for eloquence. We are _homo eloquens_. It is a\npotential in everyone. More than a potential. I\u2019ve never met anyone who didn\u2019t\nshow in their conversational skills that they are capable of eloquence. The\nproblem is that most people don\u2019t think they are.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge myth surrounding eloquence. It\u2019s thought to be only for the\ngifted, or for the great and the good on prominent public occasions. All books\non eloquence reinforce the myth, because they want to show the artistic\nheights that _homo eloquens_ can reach. I\u2019m no different. My chief\nillustrations have been of well-known figures talking at important events. So\nit\u2019s important for me to end by drawing attention to the selectivity inherent\nin such a portrayal. If eloquence is the summit of a mountain, it is a\nmountain that anyone can climb. And through the normal process of language\nlearning as children we have all climbed some way up, without realizing it.\nThe evidence comes from everyday conversation.\n\nSeveral years ago linguist Derek Davy and I collected many examples of\nconversations that had been recorded without the participants\u2019 knowledge (they\nwere told afterwards, and their permission to use the recordings obtained).\nThe speakers were all adult, male and female, of various ages and widely\ndifferent educational backgrounds, and the subject matter was wide-ranging \u2013\nstories about family holidays, driving incidents, superstitions \u2026 discussions\nabout football, living in London, sex education \u2026 The material is now archived\nin the Survey of English Usage at University College London, but extracts were\npublished in a book for second-language learners,[25](part0057.html#en25)\nalong with an audio recording (so my impressions can be verified, should\nanyone think I\u2019m overstating my case).\n\nSome of the speakers spoke for two or three minutes without a break, their\nwords punctuated only by the occasional supportive vocalizations of their\nlisteners. Every one of them, I would say, was conversationally eloquent. They\nwere all natural storytellers. There was little sign of the conscious high\nartistry I described earlier in this book, such as the use of groups of three\nparallel constructions; but every speaker displayed the kind of fluent\nvariations in pace, pitch, rhythm, and paralanguage that are the foundation of\neloquent delivery.\n\nI doubt whether any of them would be comfortable at being described as _homo\neloquens_ , because most people have an image of eloquence that is of the most\nhighly crafted variety. When asked, they deny that they are or could be\neloquent. They say the sort of thing I alluded to in [Chapter\n3](part0010.html#ch3):\n\nI don\u2019t have a good speaking voice.  \nPeople won\u2019t like my accent.  \nI\u2019ve got nothing to say.  \nPeople won\u2019t be interested in me.  \nI\u2019m no Barack Obama [or some other well-known public figure].\n\nI\u2019m not sure where these notions come from. They might be revealed on a\npsychiatrist\u2019s couch. They all stem from imagination, not experience. Some\npeople, indeed, may have had a bad speaking experience which put them off, but\nthey are the exceptions. Most of those who have a negative self-image of their\nspeaking skills have never actually tried them out in public.\n\nIn the days when I did research into discourse, I used to", "doc_id": "22439a5d-b692-4fdb-bd50-bcd739a29600", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2466f3217796af61bd956e9760d7a8e45193c6de684f71f5496f56bc4ea4c630", "extra_info": null, "index": 25, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 330623, "end": 344333}, "image": null}, "3250671549380666939": {"text": "thing I alluded to in [Chapter\n3](part0010.html#ch3):\n\nI don\u2019t have a good speaking voice.  \nPeople won\u2019t like my accent.  \nI\u2019ve got nothing to say.  \nPeople won\u2019t be interested in me.  \nI\u2019m no Barack Obama [or some other well-known public figure].\n\nI\u2019m not sure where these notions come from.

Some\npeople, indeed, may have had a bad speaking experience which put them off, but\nthey are the exceptions. Most of those who have a negative self-image of their\nspeaking skills have never actually tried them out in public.\n\nIn the days when I did research into discourse, I used to record a\nconversation, without the participants being aware that they were being\nrecorded, and later play it back to them. They are invariably surprised about\nhow fluent they are. They tell each other dramatic stories, repeat a lengthy\njoke with great facility, and in almost journalistic vein report the whole of\nwhat happened in the previous night\u2019s TV episode. If they can do this talking\nto one person, or two, without worrying about their fluency or their accent,\nthen there\u2019s the potential to do this to ten, or twenty, or two hundred. The\nissue is one of confidence rather than linguistic inadequacy.\n\nThe question of accent isn\u2019t as critical as it once was, thanks to a greater\nexperience of regional accents on radio and television. In the days when only\none accent was heard and respected in the media (the so-called \u2018received\npronunciation\u2019 of the upper classes in the south-east of England), the social\npressure to use that accent on public occasions was considerable. Regional\nspeech was considered uneducated and inferior. I\u2019ve been told many personal\nhistories of how people went to elocutionists in order to improve their\nspeaking voice \u2013 which usually meant getting rid of their regional accent.\nToday, people can still go to voice coaches to help them improve their\nspeaking skills, but the emphasis is now on clarity and fluency and breath\ncontrol, not on accent. It could hardly be otherwise when many leading BBC\nradio and television presenters are daily heard speaking with identifiable\nregional voices, and local broadcasting stations routinely display the accents\nof their own communities. Similar diversity is now the norm all over the\nEnglish-speaking world.\n\nHaving said that, it has to be recognized that old attitudes take a long time\nto die out. Criticism of regional voices can still be encountered, and there\nis still a fear of being judged negatively simply because of accent. I\u2019ve\ntalked to many students taking part in inter-schools debating competitions,\nsuch as those organized by the English-Speaking Union in the UK, and have been\nstruck by how often they are fearful that their regional accent will lose them\nmarks. I try to reassure them \u2013 having judged such a competition once myself,\nand knowing several of the present-day judges \u2013 that their fear is totally\nwithout foundation. But it is nonetheless there.\n\nAnother myth lies behind the self-denigrating comments that \u2018I\u2019ve got nothing\nto say\u2019 and \u2018People won\u2019t be interested in me\u2019. Everyone has got something to\nsay \u2013 not just because we all have our own opinions about things, but because\nlife experiences differ. No two people have the same upbringing. No two people\nhave lived in exactly the same places. No two collectors have the same\ncollection. Everyone has an interest they can and do talk about, and on which\nthey can offer a unique perspective. It might be football, racing cars,\nknitting, gardening, travel, _The Simpsons_ \u2026 or Shakespeare, local politics,\nclimate change \u2026 Out there are people who will indeed be \u2018interested in me\u2019.\nThe issue is one of opportunity to expound rather than lack of knowledge.\n\nAnd having said that, we have to recognize that anything we like talking about\ncan be enhanced by doing some research. None of us has all the facts of our\nfavourite topic at our fingertips. And we never fail to learn something new\nwhen we spend a short time delving into it further. Once upon a time, this\nwould require a trip to the local library. Today, the world of knowledge is in\nour living rooms, thanks to the internet. And if we are not electronically\nconnected at home, the local library will almost certainly provide an\nalternative means of accessing online services \u2013 as well as providing\nenquirers with excellent advice about what is available on their topic and\nwhere it can be found. Librarians are the unsung heroes behind many an\neloquent performance.\n\nWhat about the last comment above: \u2018I\u2019m no Barack Obama\u2019? Comparisons with\nfamous figures actually have a value, if they\u2019re turned into a learning tool.\nIt\u2019s possible to learn a great deal from the eloquence techniques that others\nuse \u2013 from Barack Obama to our own Uncle Joe or Auntie Ellen \u2013 as long as we\ndon\u2019t try to be an exact copy, but assimilate them into our own style. There\nare illustrious precedents. Winston Churchill, in the years before he became\nknown for his oratory, read all the major speeches of the past and often\nvisited the public gallery of the House of Commons to listen to the speeches\nof his contemporaries. The outcome was not a copy of any of them, but a unique\npersonal style.\n\nWhen Churchill was twenty-two, he wrote an essay called \u2018The Scaffolding of\nRhetoric\u2019: \u2018Of all the talents bestowed upon men, none is so precious as the\ngift of oratory. He who enjoys it wields a power more durable than that of a\ngreat king. He is an independent force in the world.\u2019 Or she. Churchill was\nthinking of the great orators of history, the vocal virtuosi. Eventually he\nwould join their ranks himself. But he had to work hard to do so. So do those\nwho become great rappers and talk-show hosts. So do we all. As the American\nessayist Ralph Waldo Emerson reassuringly observed, \u2018All the great speakers\nwere bad speakers at first.\u2019[26](part0057.html#en26)\n\nWe\u2019re helped, of course, if schools foster eloquence. Some schools make a big\nthing of it. I was struck by the way sixteen-year-old Ivo Delingpole described\nthe role of his school in this respect, in an article called \u2018How Eton Works\u2019:\n\nto succeed at Eton you do have to use a certain amount of persuasiveness,\nwhether it\u2019s arguing your case to the headmaster when you\u2019ve done something\nwrong and you\u2019ve been put on \u2018The Bill\u2019 (report), convincing your \u2018beak\u2019\n(teacher) not to give you a long \u2018EW\u2019 (piece of homework), or talking people\ninto coming to your house play when they might have something better to do \u2026\n\nPeople often say that Etonians are recognisable because of the confidence they\nexude. I suppose it comes from ease in conversation. From what I\u2019ve seen,\nEtonians are brilliant at buttering people up. There are lots of opportunities\nto practise it. Whether it be dinner in your housemaster\u2019s private dining\nroom, taking a visiting speaker out, or cooking supper at your tutor\u2019s, you\u2019re\noften participating in intelligent conversation with grown-ups.\n\nAnd he draws an interesting parallel:\n\nWhen you find yourself on \u2018The Bill\u2019, trying to justify your actions to the\nheadmaster in the oldest schoolroom in the country, it\u2019s eerily similar to\narguing in court.[27](part0057.html#en27)\n\nWe mustn\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that this kind of thing is only\npossible in the top public schools. Eton is by no means alone in fostering\nthis kind of daily eloquence; but it\u2019s certainly not the norm in most schools.\nSome do have debating societies and go in for national competitions. It ought\nto be \u2018all\u2019. It should be standard practice in any school to have a debating\nsociety, or at least a forum where students can engage in supervised\ndiscussion, with everyone having a turn, on topics that are important to them.\nEloquence needs to be valued as an end in itself; and if appreciation of what\nit is hasn\u2019t come naturally from the kind of home environment I described in\nmy Prologue, then it needs to be carefully nurtured in school.\n\nIn the end, eloquence comes down to the two themes that permeate this book:\npreparation and rehearsal. It applies to all the forms and levels of eloquence\nthat I introduced in my opening chapter, whether the result of reading aloud,\nbeing assisted by notes and technology, or being apparently spontaneous. The\n\u2018apparently\u2019 is important. As Mark Twain remarked in a speech to the\nWhitefriars Club in 1899: \u2018Impromptu speaking \u2026 That is a difficult thing. I\nused to begin about a week ahead, and write out my impromptu speech and get it\nby heart.\u2019 Oscar Wilde summed it up: \u2018Spontaneity is a meticulously prepared\nart.\u2019\n\nI believe that anyone with normal language skills has the gift of the gab \u2013\nthat is, they have a natural ability to achieve a level of effective and\nappreciated eloquence, once they devote time and energy to proper preparation\nand rehearsal. And the first step in that process, to my mind, is to\nunderstand, in the words of my sub-title, \u2018how eloquence works\u2019.\n\nThat simple \u2018how\u2019 question covers so much. Whatever the occasion \u2013 family and\nfriends, clubs and societies, schools and churches, lectures and conferences,\nspeeches and debates, broadcasts and podcasts \u2013 we\u2019ve seen it raise practical\nconsiderations of time-keeping, microphone technique, and audience awareness.\nIt draws attention to tried and tested performance considerations, such as the\nrule of three, end-weight, and order of mention \u2013 strategies that make the\nspeaker more effective and the listener\u2019s task easier. And it makes us\nappreciate the vocal techniques that are intimately involved in effective\ndelivery, such as speech rate, rhythm, and intonation. All of us. From the\nuncertain first-timer to the talented old hand, everyone can benefit from an\nunderstanding of what really lies behind \u2018the gift of the gab\u2019.\n\n\nAppendix 1\n\nObama\u2019s victory speech delivered at Grant Park, Chicago, 4 November 2008\n\n_This is a transcription of the entire speech used as the main example\nin[Chapter 9](part0022.html#ch9) and following. In those chapters, to aid ease\nof reading, I used normal sentence capitalization and punctuation, such as is\nfound in the CNN transcript of the speech. However, it can be misleading to\nwrite out a speech in this way without seeing the original, so below I put\neverything in lower-case, apart from proper names and the pronoun \u2018I\u2019, and\nreplace punctuation by representing Obama\u2019s main pauses from shortest (-) to\nlongest (--), the latter often of some length because of crowd cheering. I\nalso transcribe the few non-fluencies. I don\u2019t retain the CNN paragraphing \u2013\nwhich breaks the speech down into far smaller paragraphs than, say, the BBC\ntranscript does \u2013 and I make corrections in a few places where every\ntranscript I have seen has made errors. The speech is easily viewable in\nvarious locations online._\n\nhello Chicago ---\n\nif there - is anyone out there -- who still doubts - that America is a place\nwhere - all things are possible -- who still wonders -

and immaturity that has poisoned our politics\nfor so long --\n\nlet\u2019s remember that it was a man from this state - who first carried the\nbanner of the Republican Party to the White House -- a party founded on the\nvalues of self-reliance - and individual liberty - and national unity -- those\nare values that we all share - and while the Democratic Party has won a great\nvictory tonight - we do so with a measure of humility -- and determination to\nheal the divides - that have held back our progress --- as Lincoln said to a\nnation far more divided than ours -- \u2018we are not enemies but friends -- though\npassion may have strained - it must not break our bonds of affection\u2019 -- and\nto those Americans who -

we will defeat you -- to those who seek peace and security -\nwe support you -- and to all those who have wondered if America\u2019s beacon still\nburns as bright - tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our\nnation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth but\nfrom the enduring power of our ideals - democracy - liberty - opportunity -\nand unyielding hope --- that\u2019s the true genius of America -- that America can\nchange -- our union can be perfected -- and what we\u2019ve already achieved gives\nus hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow --\n\nthis election had many firsts - and many stories that will be told for\ngenerations but - one that\u2019s on my mind tonight\u2019s about a woman - who cast her\nballot in Atlanta -- she is a lot like the millions of others who stood in\nline to make their voice heard in this election - except for one thing - Ann\nNixon Cooper is 106 years old ---\n\nshe was born just a generation past slavery - a time when there were no cars\non the road or planes in the sky - when someone like her couldn\u2019t vote for two\nreasons because she was a woman - and because of the color of her skin -- and\ntonight - I think about all that she\u2019s seen throughout her century in America\n-- the heartache and the hope - the struggle and the progress - the times we\nwere told that we can\u2019t - and the people who pressed on with that American\ncreed \u2018yes we can\u2019 --\n\nat a time when women\u2019s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed - she\nlived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot - yes we can\n--\n\nwhen there was despair in the Dust Bowl and - depression across the land - she\nsaw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal - new jobs - a new sense of\ncommon purpose - yes we can --\n\nCROWD: yes we can\n\nwhen the bombs fell on our harbor - and tyranny threatened the world she was\nthere to witness a generation rise to greatness - and a democracy was saved -\nyes we can --\n\nCROWD: yes we can\n\nshe was there for the buses in Montgomery -

This momentous decree came as a\ngreat beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in\nthe flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the\nlong night of their captivity.\n\nBut one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years\nlater, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of\nsegregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the\nNegro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of\nmaterial prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in\nthe corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So\nwe have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.\n\nIn a sense we\u2019ve come to our nation\u2019s Capital to cash a check. When the\narchitects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and\nthe Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which\nevery American was to fall heir.\n\nThis note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men,\nwould be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit\nof happiness.\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar\nas her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred\nobligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has\ncome back marked \u2018insufficient funds.\u2019\n\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to\nbelieve that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity\nof this nation. So we have come to cash this check \u2013 a check that will give us\nupon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\n\nWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce\nurgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to\ntake the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.\n\nNow is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to\nrise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of\nracial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of\nracial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make\njustice a reality for all of God\u2019s children.\n\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This\nsweltering summer of the Negro\u2019s legitimate discontent will not pass until\nthere is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three\nis not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow\noff steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation\nreturns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in\nAmerica until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of\nrevolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright\nday of justice emerges.\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm\nthreshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining\nour rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to\nsatisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and\nhatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and\ndiscipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical\nviolence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting\nphysical force with soul force.\n\nThe marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not\nlead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as\nevidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their\ndestiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their\nfreedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\n\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We\ncannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights,\n\u2018When will you be satisfied?\u2019\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the\nunspeakable horrors of police brutality.\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of\ntravel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of\nthe cities.\n\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro\u2019s basic mobility is from a smaller\nghetto to a larger one.\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their\nselfhood and robbed of their", "doc_id": "afc641c0-ddee-453f-bd75-21d0ca94434c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1f533fec519e93437c1d024e204b358c2490f9f947cf1623fbad324f5c9b7390", "extra_info": null, "index": 27, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "83db7a4a-1cb1-4735-a2fd-b5b3c7ed2e3c", "node_info": {"start": 358364, "end": 372497}, "image": null}, "2609436904935690248": {"text": "as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.

Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you\nhave come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the\nstorms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have\nbeen the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that\nunearned suffering is redemptive.\n\nGo back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back\nto Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our\nnorthern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.\nLet us not wallow in the valley of despair.\n\nI say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of\ntoday and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the\nAmerican dream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true\nmeaning of its creed: \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men\nare created equal.\u2019\n\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former\nslaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together\nat the table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering\nwith the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be\ntransformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation\nwhere they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of\ntheir character.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with\nits governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and\nnullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black\ngirls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as\nsisters and brothers.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and\nmountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the\ncrooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be\nrevealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with.\nWith this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone\nof hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of\nour nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.\n\nWith this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to\nstruggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together,\nknowing that we will be free one day.\n\nThis will be the day when all of God\u2019s children will be able to sing with new\nmeaning, \u2018My country \u2019tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land\nwhere my fathers died, land of the Pilgrims\u2019 pride, from every mountainside,\nlet freedom ring.\u2019\n\nAnd if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.\n\nSo let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.\n\nLet freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.\n\nLet freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.\n\nLet freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.\n\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.\n\nBut not only that; let freedom ring from the Stone Mountain of Georgia.\n\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.\n\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.\n\nFrom every mountainside, let freedom ring.\n\nAnd when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring\nfrom every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will\nbe able to speed up that day when all of God\u2019s children, black men and white\nmen, Jews and gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands\nand sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, \u2018Free at last! Free at last!\nThank God Almighty, we are free at last!\u2019\n\n\nEndnotes\n\n[1.](part0006.html#nr1)Denis Donoghue, _On Eloquence_ , New Haven and London:\nYale University Press, 2008, p. 154.\n\n[2.](part0008_split_003.html#nr2)Tenor Films, \u2018The Bertsolaris: Discover the\nBasque Country\u2019, <https://vimeo.com/106061107>, accessed 24 November 2015.\n\n[3.](part0010.html#nr3)Cicero, _Orator_ , 17.56 and 3.213.\n\n[4.](part0010.html#nr4)Quintilian, _Institutes of Oratory_ , Book 11, Chapter\n3.\n\n[5.](part0010.html#nr5)Aristotle, _Rhetoric_ , Book 3, Chapter 1.\n\n[6.](part0010.html#nr6)Sam Leith, _You Talkin\u2019 To Me?
