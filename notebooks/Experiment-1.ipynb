       "An international convention would \"normalize\" the various standard\n",

       "(never built) was intended to appeal to Soviet high modernism. The building,\n",
       "he claimed, would establish precise and universal new standards for all\n",

       "The straight line, the right angle, and the imposition of international\n",

       "simplification. Perhaps the most decisive step, however, was Le Corbusier's\n",
       "lifelong insistence on strict functional separation. Indicative of this\n",
       "doctrine was the second of fourteen principles he enunciated at the beginning\n",
       "of La ville radieuse, namely, \"the death of the street.\" What he meant by this\n",
       "was simply the complete separation of pedestrian traffic from vehicle traffic\n",
       "and, beyond that, the segregation of slowfrom fast-moving vehicles. He\n",
       "abhorred the mingling of pedestrians and vehicles, which made walking\n",
       "unpleasant and impeded the circulation of traffic.\n",
       "\n",
       "The principle of functional segregation was applied across the board. Written\n",
       "by Le Corbusier and his brother Pierre, the final report for the second\n",
       "meeting of c1AM, in 1929, began with an assault on traditional housing\n",
       "construction: \"The poverty, the inadequacy of traditional techniques have\n",

       "doctrine until the late 1960s. There would be separate zones for workplaces,\n",
       "residences, shopping and entertainment centers, and monuments and government\n",
       "buildings. Where possible, work zones were to be further subdivided into\n",
       "office buildings and factories. Le Corbusier's insistence on an urban plan in\n",
       "which each district had one and only one function was evident in his first act\n",
       "after taking over the planning of Chandigarh, his only built city. He replaced\n",
       "the housing that had been planned for the city center with an \"acropolis of\n",
       "monuments\" on a 220-acre site at a great distance from the nearest\n",
       "residences.20 In his Plan Voisin for Paris, he separated what he called la\n",
       "ville, which was for dwelling, and the business center, which was for working.\n",

       "representative of two distinct and categorically separate areas.\"21\n",

       "terms of relative efficiency. This logic is eminently reasonable inasmuch as\n",
       "this is precisely what we have in mind when we build a road from A to B.\n",
       "Notice, however, that the clarity is achieved by bracketing the many other\n",
       "purposes that we may want roads to serve, such as affording the leisure of a\n",
       "touristic drive, providing aesthetic beauty or visual interest, or enabling\n",
       "the transfer of heavy goods. Even in the case of roads, narrow criteria of\n",

       "The author's opinion on standardisation and central planning is that it is often an ineffective and self-serving approach. The author argues that it is far easier for would-be reformers to change the formal structure of an institution than to change its practices, and that attempting to completely plan a village, a city, or a language is certain to run afoul of the complex web of activity that is necessary for successful operation. The author also suggests that the miniaturization of perfection, such as model villages, model cities, military colonies, show projects, and demonstration farms, is a way for politicians and administrators to create a sharply defined experimental terrain in which the number of rogue variables and unknowns are minimized, but that this approach often fails to bring about large-scale transformations. The author further argues that miniaturization of perfection has a logic all its own, in spite of its implicit abandonment of large-scale transformations, as it offers politicians, administrators, and specialists an opportunity to create a sharply defined experimental terrain in which the number of rogue variables and unknowns are minimized. However, the author acknowledges that if such experiments make it successfully from the pilot stage to general application, then they are a perfectly rational form of policy planning.</b>"

This kind of planning should also modestly enhance rather than impede the development of urban complexity, and make room for the unexpected, small, informal, and even nonproductive human activities that constitute the vitality of the \"lived city.\" Jacobs also believes that planners should not usurp the unplanned city, and should instead focus on developing cities that are congenial places for the great range of unofficial plans, ideas, and opportunities to flourish. Furthermore, Jacobs emphasizes that our capacity for prediction is practically nil, and that formulas about density, green space, and transportation may produce narrowly efficient outcomes, but are unlikely to result in a desirable place to live.</b>"

       "The author is discussing the differences between episteme (theoretical knowledge) and metis (practical knowledge). They discuss how metis is implicit in modern activities, such as factory work and research laboratories, and how it is often overlooked in favor of episteme. They also discuss how metis is often found in traditional cultures, such as the Bugis people, and how it is used in everyday life, such as in sports and cooking. The author also discusses how epistemic economics has narrowed its focus, but has grown in reach, such as with William D. Nordhaus' attempts to treat ecological issues with precision. Finally, they discuss how metis is often used in scientific research, and how it is often more accurate than episteme, even when dealing with complex issues such as public goods.</b>"
